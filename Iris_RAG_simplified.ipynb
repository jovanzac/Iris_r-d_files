       "Activity 8.4: Male and female unisexual flowers may be present in the same plant or in different plants. Take a mustard/China rose/petunia flower and separate its reproductive parts. Study the various parts of a stamen and pistil. Anther contains pollen grains which produce male gametes. A pistil consists of stigma, style, and ovary. Ovary contains one or more ovules. The female gamete or the egg is formed in an ovule [Fig. 8.9 (b)]. In sexual reproduction, a male and a female gamete fuse to form a zygote. Boojho wants to know how the male gamete in the pollen grain reaches the female gamete present in the ovule. Filament Pollination Generally, pollen grains have a tough protective coat which prevents them from drying up. Since pollen grains are light, they can be carried by wind or insects. Flowers which contain either only pistil or only stamens are called unisexual flowers. Flowers which contain both stamens and pistil are called bisexual flowers. Corn, papaya, and cucumber produce unisexual flowers, whereas mustard, rose, and petunia have bisexual flowers. Both male gamete in the pollen grain reaches the female gamete present in the ovule.

Both fire and water had clearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was stuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the end, I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of my fist, and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space underneath, a secret drawer. There was something in there. I reached in and took out a small black tin box. Sello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper, and written on it in shaky handwriting: “Jim’s last letter, received January 25, 1915. To be buried with me when the time comes.” I knew as I did it that it was wrong of me to open the box, but curiosity got the better of my scruples. It usually does. Inside the box, there was an envelope. The address read: “Mrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport, Dorset.” I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written in pencil and dated at the top — “December 26, 1914”.\\n\\nComprehension Check:\\n1. What did the author find in a junk shop?\\n2. What did he find in a secret drawer?

And no one did. \\n\\nThen there was another Fritz up on the parapet, and another. \"Keep your heads down,\" I told the men, \"it\\'s a trick.\" But it wasn\\'t. One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his head. \"It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps. We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?\" By this time, there were dozens of them walking towards us across no man\\'s land, and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris was the first up. \"Come on, boys. What are we waiting for?\" And then there was no stopping them. I was the officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to me I should. \\n\\nAll along their line and ours, I could see men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats, khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war, we were making peace.

I’m a school teacher from Dorset, in the west of England.” “Ah, Dorset,” he smiled. “I know this place. I know it very well.” We shared my rum ration and his excellent sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke almost perfect English. But it turned out that he had never set foot in Dorset, never even been to England. He had learned all he knew of England from school, and from reading books in English. His favourite writer was Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the Madding Crowd. So out there in no man’s land we talked of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months ago. As I looked about me, there were huddles of khaki and grey everywhere, all over no man’s land, smoking, laughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I shared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake, Connie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had ever tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and yet he was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party cake made like it, Connie. Then someone, I don’t know who, brought out a football. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make goalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy against Fritz out in the middle of no man’s land. Hans Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as anything. There was a moment when I noticed our breaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too and smiled. “Jim Macpherson,” he said after a while, “I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football match. No one dies in a football match. No children are orphaned. No wives become widows.” “I’d prefer cricket,” I told him. “Then we Tommies could be sure of winning, probably.” We laughed at that, and together we watched the game.

      "I spotted it from a a junk shop in Bridport, a roll-top desk. The man said it was early nineteenth century, and oak. It was going for a high price, but I thought it was selling for very little money because it was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces, one leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one side. I thought I could restore it. It would be a risk, a challenge, but I had to have it. I paid the man and brought it back to my workroom at the back of the garage. I began work on it on Christmas Eve. I removed the roll-top completely and pulled out the drawers. The veneer had lifted almost everywhere — it was cheap wood.\n",

      "It looked like water damage to me. Both fire and water had clearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was stuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the end, I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of my fist, and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space underneath, a secret drawer. There was something in there. I reached in and took out a small black tin box. Sello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper, and written on it in shaky handwriting: “Jim’s last letter, received January 25, 1915. To be buried with me when the time comes.” I knew as I did it that it was wrong of me to open the box, but curiosity got the better of my scruples. It usually does. Inside the box, there was an envelope. The address read: “Mrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport, Dorset.” I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written in pencil and dated at the top — “December 26, 1914”.\n",

It was crisp and quiet all about, as beautiful a morning as I've ever seen, as cold and frosty as a Christmas morning should be. I should like to be able to tell you that we began it. But the truth, I'm ashamed to say, is that Fritz began it. \n",

      "First, someone saw a white flag waving from the trenches opposite. Then they were calling out to us from across no man's land, \"Happy Christmas, Tommy! Happy Christmas!\" When we had got over the surprise, some of us shouted back, \"Same to you, Fritz! Same to you!\" I thought that would be that. We all did. But then suddenly one of them was up there in his grey greatcoat and waving a white flag. \"Don't shoot, lads!\" someone shouted. And no one did. \n",

      "Then there was another Fritz up on the parapet, and another. \"Keep your heads down,\" I told the men, \"it's a trick.\" But it wasn't. One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his head. \"It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps. We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?\" By this time, there were dozens of them walking towards us across no man's land, and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris was the first up. \"Come on, boys. What are we waiting for?\" And then there was no stopping them. I was the officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to me I should. \n",

      "All along their line and ours, I could see men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats, khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war, we were making peace. You cannot imagine, dearest Connie, my feelings as I looked into the eyes of the Fritz officer, who approached me, hand outstretched. \"Hans Wolf,\" he said, gripping my hand warmly and holding it. \"I am from Dusseldorf.

      "“Captain Jim Macpherson,” I replied. “And a Happy Christmas to you too. I’m a school teacher from Dorset, in the west of England.” “Ah, Dorset,” he smiled. “I know this place. I know it very well.” We shared my rum ration and his excellent sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke almost perfect English. But it turned out that he had never set foot in Dorset, never even been to England. He had learned all he knew of England from school, and from reading books in English. His favourite writer was Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the Madding Crowd. So out there in no man’s land we talked of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months ago. As I looked about me, there were huddles of khaki and grey everywhere, all over no man’s land, smoking, laughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I shared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake, Connie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had ever tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and yet he was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party cake made like it, Connie. Then someone, I don’t know who, brought out a football. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make goalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy against Fritz out in the middle of no man’s land. Hans Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as anything. There was a moment when I noticed our breaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too and smiled. “Jim Macpherson,” he said after a while, “I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football match. No one dies in a football match. No children are orphaned. No wives become widows.” “I’d prefer cricket,” I told him. “Then we Tommies could be sure of winning, probably.” We laughed at that, and together we watched the game. Sad to say, it was a moment of peace in the midst of chaos.\n",

      "Connie, Fritz won two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf generously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it wasn't quite fair. The time came, and all too soon, when the game was finished, the schnapps and the rum and the sausage had long since run out, and we knew it was all over. I wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see his family again soon, that the fighting would end and we could all go home. \"I think that is what every soldier wants, on both sides,\" Hans Wolf said. \"Take care, Jim Macpherson. I shall never forget this moment, nor you.\" He saluted and walked away from me slowly, unwillingly, I felt. He turned to wave just once and then became one of the hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards their trenches. That night, back in our dugouts, we heard them singing a carol, and singing it quite beautifully. It was Stille Nacht, Silent Night. Our boys gave them a rousing chorus of While Shepherds Watched. We exchanged carols for a while and then we all fell silent. We had had our time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as long as I live.\n",

      "I folded the letter again and slipped it carefully back into its envelope. I kept awake all night. By morning I knew what I had to do. I drove into Bridport, just a few miles away. I asked a boy walking his dog where Copper Beeches was. House number 12 turned out to be a burned-out shell, the roof gaping, the windows destroyed and boarded-up. I knocked at the house next door and asked if anyone knew the whereabouts of a Mrs Macpherson.\n",

She had been in the house when it caught fire. No one really knew how the fire had started, but it could well have been candles. She used candles rather than electricity, because she always thought electricity was too expensive. The fireman had got her out just in time.

I said I was a friend come to visit Mrs. Macpherson to bring her a Christmas present. I could see through into the dining room where everyone was wearing a paper hat and singing. The matron had a hat on too and seemed happy enough to see me. She even offered me a lit-up mince pie. She walked me along the corridor, becoming bright with happiness and excitement. \"Mrs. Macpherson is not in with the others,\" she told me. \"She's rather confused today, so we thought it best if she had a good rest. She has no family, you know, no one visits. So I'm sure she'll be only too pleased to see you.\" She took me into a conservatory with wicker chairs and potted plants all around and left me.\n",

      "The old lady was sitting in a wheelchair, her hands folded in her lap. She had silver-white hair pinned into a wispy bun. She was gazing out at the garden. \"Hello,\" I said. She turned and looked up at me vacantly. \"Happy Christmas, Connie,\" I went on. \"I found this. I think it's yours.\" As I was speaking, her eyes never left my face. I opened the tin box and gave it to her. That was the moment her eyes lit up with recognition, and her face became suffused with a sudden glow of happiness. I explained about the desk, about how I had found it, but I don't think she was listening. For a while...\n",

Oxygen is also produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which is released into the air and is essential for the survival of other living organisms.\\n\\nIn more detail, photosynthesis takes place in the leaves of plants, which are the food factories of plants. The leaves contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which helps to capture the energy of sunlight. The energy from sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates, which are then stored in the plant as food. This process is represented by the equation: Water and sunlight + minerals + Carbon dioxide → Carbohydrate + Oxygen + chlorophyll.\\n\\nPhotosynthesis is a critical process that supports life on earth. Without photosynthesis, there would be no food for plants to grow, and ultimately, no food for animals and humans to eat.

In Table 10.1, some electric components and their symbols are shown. You may come across different symbols for these components in different books. However, in this book, we shall be using the symbols shown here.\n",

They enjoyed it so much that they decided to suggest it to a cousin of theirs who stayed in a different town. So, Paheli made a neat drawing showing how the various electric components were to be connected (Fig. 10.1).\n",

      "Look at the symbols carefully. In the symbol for the electric cell, notice that there is a longer line and a shorter but thicker parallel line. Do you recall that an electric cell has a positive terminal and a negative terminal? In the symbol of the electric cell, the longer line represents the positive terminal, and the thicker, shorter line represents the negative terminal. For a switch, the 'ON' position and the 'OFF' position are represented by the symbols as shown. The wires used to connect the various components in a circuit are represented by lines. In Table 10.1, a battery and its symbol are also shown. Do you know what a battery is? Look at the symbol of a battery. Can you make out what a battery could be?\n",

However, in some of these devices, the electric cells are not always placed one after the other as shown in Fig. 10.2. Sometimes the cells are placed side by side. Then how are the terminals of the cells connected? Look carefully inside the battery compartment of any device. There is usually a thick wire or a metal strip connecting the positive terminal of one cell to the negative terminal of the next cell (Fig. 10.3). In order to help you to place the cells correctly in the battery compartment, '+' and '-' symbols are usually printed there. How can we connect the cells to prepare batteries for our activities? You may make a cell holder, as shown in Fig. 10.4, using a wooden block, two iron strips, and rubber bands. It is necessary that the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or more cells is called a battery.\n",

Activity 10.1: Make the electric circuit shown in Fig. 10.7. You used a similar circuit in Class VI to make an electric bulb glow. Do you remember that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the 'ON' position? The bulb glows as soon as the switch is moved to the 'ON' position. You could also buy cell holders from the market for making batteries of two or more electric cells. Place the cells in them properly, such that the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. The rubber bands hold the metal strips tightly. Copy this electric circuit in your notebook. Make also a circuit diagram of this circuit using symbols for the various electric components. Is your diagram similar to the one shown in Fig. 10.8? It is much easier to draw a circuit diagram using symbols. Therefore, we generally represent an electric circuit by its circuit diagram. Paheli and Boojho wonder whether the batteries used in tractors, trucks, and inverters are also made from cells. Then why is it called a battery? Can you help them to find the answer to this question? Fig. 10.9 shows another circuit diagram. Is it identical to the circuit diagram shown in Fig. 10.8? In which way is it different? Would the bulb glow in this electric circuit? Recall that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the 'ON' position and the electric circuit is closed.\n",

If you don't pay next week, I will send you to jail.\" The natives are unworthy of trust, incapable of honesty – \"True, your honour, but I am honest.\" Inevitably, famines followed. Between 1822 and 1836, fifteen lakh Indians died of starvation. Still, the British invented other methods which gave them more profits. The British policies ruined the expert artisans and their business. The goods manufactured in England should not have any import duty when brought into India.
