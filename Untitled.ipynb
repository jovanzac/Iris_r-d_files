      "             2.1    Introduction  In the earlier classes, you have come across several algebraic expressions and equations.

Of these given expressions, many have more than one variable. For example, 2xy + 5  has two variables. We however, restrict to expressions with only one variable when we  form equations. Moreover, the expressions we use to form equations are linear. This means  that the highest power of the variable appearing in the expression is 1.  These are linear expressions:  5  x  ( – 4) 10  +  2x, 2x + 1, 3y – 7, 12 – 5z,   4  These are not linear expressions:  x2 + 1, y + y2, 1 + z + z2 + z3  (since highest power of variable > 1)  Here we will deal with equations with linear expressions in one variable only. Such  equations are known as linear equations in one variable. The simple equations which  you studied in the earlier classes were all of this type.  Let us briefly revise what we know:  (a) An algebraic equation is an equality  involving variables. It  has an equality sign.  The expression on the left of the equality sign  2x – 3 = 7  is the Left Hand Side (LHS). The expression  on the right of the equality sign is the Right  2x – 3 = LHS  Hand Side (RHS).  7 = RHS  Reprint 2024-25 \n",

We perform the same mathematical operations on both  sides of the equation, so that the balance is not disturbed.  A few such steps give the solution.  2.2 Solving  Equations  having  the  Variable  on  both  Sides  An equation is the equality of the values of two expressions. In the equation 2x – 3 = 7,  the two expressions are  2x – 3 and 7.  In most examples that we have come across so  far, the RHS is just a number.  But this need not always be so; both sides could have  expressions with variables.  For example, the equation  2x – 3 = x + 2 has expressions  with a variable on both sides; the expression on the LHS is (2x – 3) and the expression  on the RHS is (x + 2).  • We now discuss how to solve such equations which have expressions with the variable  on both sides.  Example 1: Solve 2x – 3 = x + 2  Solution:  We  have  2x = x + 2 + 3  2x = x + 5  or  2x – x = x + 5 – x  (subtracting x from both sides)  or  x = 5  or  (solution)  Here we subtracted from both sides of the equation, not a number (constant), but a  term involving the variable. We can do this as variables are also numbers. Also, note that  subtracting x from both sides amounts to transposing x to LHS.  7  3  x  14  =  −  Example 2: Solve 5x +   2  2  Solution: Multiply both sides of the equation by 2.

DO  THIS  Draw  a  polygon  on  the  floor,  using  a  piece  of  chalk.  (In the figure, a pentagon ABCDE is shown) (Fig 3.2).  We  want  to  know  the  total  measure  of  angles,  i.e,  m∠1 + m∠2 + m∠3 + m∠4 + m∠5. Start at A. Walk along  AB . On reaching B, you need to turn through an angle of m∠1,  to walk along.  BC When you reach at C, you need to turn  through an angle of m∠2 to walk along CD . You continue to  move in this manner, until you return to side AB.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.  3.3.4    Elements  of  a  parallelogram  There are four sides and four angles in a parallelogram. Some of these are  equal.

      "    Observe that as you increase the number of tosses more and more, the number of  heads and the number of tails come closer and closer to each other.  This could also be done with a die, when tossed a large number of times. Number of  each of the six outcomes become almost equal  to each other.  In such cases, we may say that the different outcomes of the experiment are equally  likely. This means that each of the outcomes has the same chance of occurring.  4.3.3    Linking  chances  to  probability  Consider the experiment of tossing a coin once. What are the outcomes? There are only  two outcomes – Head or Tail. Both the outcomes are equally likely. Likelihood of getting  1  a head is one out of two outcomes, i.e.,   . In other words, we say that the probability of  2  1  getting a head =   . What is the probability of getting a tail?  2  Now take the example of throwing a die marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on its faces (one  number on one face). If you throw it once, what are the outcomes?  The outcomes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Thus, there are six equally likely outcomes.  What is the probability of getting the outcome ‘2’?  ←   Number of outcomes giving 2  1  It is  ←   Number of equally likely outcomes.  6  What is the probability of getting the number 5? What is the probability of getting the  number 7? What is the probability of getting a number 1 through 6?  4.3.4    Outcomes  as  events  Each outcome of an experiment or a collection of outcomes make an event.  For example in the experiment of tossing a coin, getting a Head is an event and getting a  Tail is also an event.  In case of throwing a die, getting each of the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is an event.  Reprint 2024-25 \n",

      "     Is getting an even number an event? Since an even number could be 2, 4 or 6, getting an  even number is also an event. What will be the probability of getting an even number?  ←   Number of outcomes that make the event  3  It is  ←   Total number of outcomes of the experiment.  6  Example 3: A bag has 4 red balls and 2 yellow balls. (The balls are identical in all  respects other than colour). A ball is drawn from the bag without looking into the bag.  What is probability of getting a red ball? Is it more or less than getting a yellow ball?  Solution:  There are in all (4 + 2 =) 6 outcomes of  the event. Getting a red ball  consists of 4 outcomes. (Why?)  4  2  Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is   =   . In the same way the probability  6  3  2  1  =  (Why?). Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is  of getting a yellow ball =   6  3  more than that of getting a yellow ball.  TRY  THESE  Suppose you spin the wheel  1.

Fig  4.8  (iii) Find the probability of not getting a green sector.  4.3.5    Chance  and  probability  related  to  real  life  We talked about the chance that it rains just on the day when we do not carry a rain coat.  What could you say about the chance in terms of probability? Could it be one in 10  1  days during a rainy season? The probability that it rains is then   . The probability that it  10  9  does not rain =   . (Assuming raining or not raining on a day are equally likely)  10  The use of probability is made in various cases in real life.  1. To find characteristics of a large group by using a small  part of the group.  For example, during elections ‘an exit poll’ is taken.  This involves asking the people whom they have voted  for, when they come out after voting at the centres  which are chosen off  hand and distributed over the  whole area. This gives an idea of chance of winning of  each candidate and predictions are made based on it  accordingly.  Reprint 2024-25 \n",

Between 22(= 4) and 32(= 9) there are four (i.e., 2 × 2) non square numbers 5, 6, 7, 8.  32 = 9,       42 = 16  Now,  42 – 32 = 16 – 9 = 7  Therefore,  Between 9(=32) and 16(= 42) the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 that is, six  non-square numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.  We have  42 = 16     and     52 = 25  Therefore,  52 – 42 = 9  Between 16(= 42) and 25(= 52) the numbers are 17, 18, ... , 24 that is, eight non square  numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.  Consider 72 and 62. Can you say how many numbers are there between 62 and 72?  If we think of any natural number n and (n + 1), then,  (n + 1)2 – n2 = (n2 + 2n + 1) – n2 = 2n + 1.  We find that between n2 and (n + 1)2 there are 2n numbers which is 1 less than the  difference of two squares.  Thus, in general we can say that there are 2n non perfect square numbers between  the squares of the numbers n and (n + 1). Check for n = 5, n = 6 etc., and verify.  Reprint 2024-25 \n",

      "    Can you find more such triplets?  For any natural number m > 1, we have (2m)2 + (m2 – 1)2 = (m2 + 1)2. So, 2m,  m2 – 1 and m2 + 1 forms a Pythagorean triplet.  Try to find some more Pythagorean triplets using this form.  Example 2: Write a Pythagorean triplet whose smallest member is 8.  Solution: We can get Pythagorean triplets by using general form 2m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1.  m2 – 1 = 8  Let us first take  m2 = 8 + 1 = 9  So,  m = 3  which gives  2m = 6   and    m2 + 1 = 10  Therefore,  The triplet is thus 6, 8, 10.  But 8 is not the smallest member of this.  2m = 8  So, let us try  m = 4  then  m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15  We get  m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17  and  The triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member.  Example 3: Find a Pythagorean triplet in which one member is 12.  Solution:  If  we  take  m2 – 1 = 12  m2 = 12 + 1 = 13  Then,  Then the value of m will not be an integer.  So, we try to take m2 + 1 = 12. Again m2 = 11 will not give an integer value for m.  2m = 12  So, let us take  m = 6  then  m2 – 1 = 36 – 1 = 35    and m2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37  Thus,  Therefore, the required triplet is 12, 35, 37.  Note: All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this form. For example another  triplet 5, 12, 13 also has 12 as a member.  EXERCISE  5.2  1. Find the square of the following numbers.

But 8 is not the smallest member of this.  2m = 8  So, let us try  m = 4  then  m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15  We get  m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17  and  The triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member.

Suppose we want to find the smallest multiple of 48 that is a perfect square, how  should we proceed? Making pairs of the prime factors of 48 we see that 3 is the only  factor that does not have a pair. So we need to multiply by 3 to complete the pair.  2  6400  Hence  48 × 3 = 144 is a perfect square.  Can you tell by which number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square?  2  3200  The factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3 we get 48 ÷ 3 = 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  2  1600  and this number 16 is a perfect square too.  2  800  Example 4: Find the square root of 6400.  2  400  2  200  Solution: Write 6400 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5  2  100  Therefore  6400  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80  2  90  2  50  3  45  Example 5: Is 90 a perfect square?  3  15  5  25  5  Solution: We have 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5  5  The prime factors 2 and 5 do not occur in pairs. Therefore, 90 is not a perfect square.  That 90 is not a perfect square can also be seen from the fact that  it has only one zero.  Example 6: Is 2352 a perfect square? If not, find the smallest multiple of 2352 which  2  2352  is a perfect square. Find the square root of the new number.  2  1176  2  588  Solution: We have 2352 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7  As the prime factor 3 has no pair, 2352 is not a perfect square.  2  294  If 3 gets a pair then the number will become perfect square. So, we multiply 2352 by 3 to get,  3  147  2352 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7  7  49  Now each prime factor is in a pair. Therefore, 2352 × 3 = 7056   is a perfect square.  7  Thus the required smallest multiple of 2352 is 7056 which is a perfect square.  And,  7056  = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84  Example 7: Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be divided so that the  quotient is a perfect square. Find the square root of the quotient.

      "    Solution: We have, 9408 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7  If we divide 9408 by the factor 3, then  9408 ÷ 3 = 3136 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7  which is a perfect square. (Why?)  Therefore, the required smallest number is 3.  3136  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.

First find the smallest common multiple and  then find the square number needed. The least number divisible by each one of 6, 9 and  5  1, 1, 5  15 is their LCM. The LCM of 6, 9 and 15 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90.  1, 1, 1  Prime factorisation of 90 is 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5.  We see that prime factors 2 and 5 are not in pairs. Therefore 90 is not a perfect  square.  In order to get a perfect square, each factor of 90 must be paired. So we need to  make pairs of 2 and 5. Therefore, 90 should be multiplied by 2 × 5, i.e., 10.  Hence, the required square number is 90 × 10 = 900.  EXERCISE  5.3  1. What could be the possible ‘one’s’ digits of the square root of each of the following  numbers?

Now let us check for 500.  Prime factorisation of 500 is 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5.  So, 500 is not a perfect cube.  There are three  Example 1: Is 243 a perfect cube?  5’s in the product but  only two 2’s.  Solution: 243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3  In the above factorisation 3 × 3 remains after grouping the 3’s in triplets. Therefore, 243 is  not a perfect cube.

Length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 cm,  30 cm, 15 cm respectively.  Anu asks how many such cuboids will she need to make a perfect cube? Can you tell?  Raj said, Volume of cuboid is 15 × 30 × 15  = 3 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 3 × 5    = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5  Since there is only one 2 in the prime factorisation. So we need 2 × 2, i.e., 4 to make  it a perfect cube. Therefore, we need 4 such cuboids to make a cube.  Example 2: Is 392 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest natural number by which  392 must be multiplied so that the product is a perfect cube.  Solution: 392 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7  The prime factor 7 does not appear in a group of three. Therefore, 392 is not a perfect  cube. To make its a cube, we need one more 7. In that case  392 × 7 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 2744           which is a perfect cube.  Reprint 2024-25 \n",

If not, then by which smallest natural number  should 53240 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube?  Solution: 53240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 11 × 11 × 5  The prime factor 5 does not appear in a group of three. So, 53240 is not a perfect cube.  In the factorisation 5 appears only one time. If we divide the number by 5, then the prime  factorisation of the quotient will not contain 5.  53240 ÷ 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 11 × 11  So,  Hence the smallest number by which 53240 should be divided to make it a perfect  cube is 5.  The perfect cube in that case is = 10648.  Example 4: Is 1188 a perfect cube? If not, by which smallest natural number should  1188 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube?  Solution: 1188 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 11  The primes 2 and 11 do not appear in groups of three. So, 1188 is not a perfect cube. In  the factorisation of 1188 the prime 2 appears only two times and the prime 11 appears  once. So, if we divide 1188 by 2 × 2 × 11 = 44, then the prime factorisation of the  quotient will not contain 2 and 11.  Hence the smallest natural number by which 1188 should be divided to make it a  perfect cube is 44.  And the resulting perfect cube is 1188 ÷ 44 = 27 (=33).  Example 5: Is 68600 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest number by which 68600  must be multiplied to get a perfect cube.  Solution: We have, 68600 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7. In this factorisation, we  find that there is no triplet of 5.  So, 68600 is not a perfect cube. To make it  a perfect cube we multiply it by 5.  Thus,  68600 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7  = 343000,   which is a perfect cube.  Observe that 343 is a perfect cube. From Example 5 we know that 343000 is also  perfect cube.

      "    Sales tax (ST) is charged by the government on the sale of an item. It is collected by the  shopkeeper from the customer and given to the government. This is, therefore, always on  the selling price of an item and is added to the value of the bill. There is another type of tax  which is included in the prices known as Value Added Tax (VAT).  From July 1, 2017, Government of India introduced GST which stands for Goods and  Services Tax which is levied on supply of goods or services or both.  Example 4: (Finding Sales Tax) The cost of a pair of  roller skates at a shop was  450. The sales tax charged was  5%. Find the bill amount.  Solution:  On  100, the tax paid was  5.  5  450  On  450, the tax paid would be =    ×  100  =  22.50  Bill amount = Cost of item + Sales tax =  450 +  22.50 =  472.50.  Example 5: (Value Added Tax (VAT)) Waheeda bought an air cooler for  3300  including a tax of 10%. Find the price of the air cooler before VAT was added.  Solution: The price includes the VAT, i.e., the value added tax. Thus, a 10% VAT  means if the price without VAT is  100 then price including VAT is  110.  Now, when price including VAT is  110, original price is  100.  100  3300  3000.  =   Hence when price including tax is  3300, the original price =    ×  110  Example 6: Salim bought an article for  784 which included GST of 12% . What is  the price of the article before GST was added?  Solution: Let original price of the article be   100.  GST = 12%.  Price after GST is included =  (100+12) =  112  When the selling price is  112 then original price =  100.

      "    Normally, the interest paid or charged is never simple. The interest is calculated on the  amount of the previous year. This is known as interest compounded or Compound  Interest (C.I.).  Let us take an example and find the interest year by year. Each year our sum or  principal changes.  Calculating Compound Interest  A sum of  20,000 is borrowed by Heena for 2 years at an interest of 8% compounded  annually. Find the Compound Interest (C.I.) and the amount she has to pay at the end of  2 years.  Aslam asked the teacher whether this means that they should find the interest year by  year. The teacher said ‘yes’,  and asked him to use the following steps :  1. Find the Simple Interest (S.I.) for one year.  Let the principal for the first year be P1. Here, P1 =  20,000  20000 8  ×  SI1 = SI at 8% p.a. for 1st year =     =  1600  100  2. Then find the amount which will be paid or received. This becomes principal for the  next year.  Amount at the end of 1st year = P1 + SI1 =  20000 +  1600  =  21600 = P2 (Principal for 2nd year)  3. Again find the interest on this sum for another year.  21600 8  ×  SI2 = SI at 8% p.a.for 2nd year =    100  =  1728  4. Find the amount which has to be paid or received at the end of second year.  Amount at the end of 2nd year = P2 + SI2  =  21600 +  1728  =  23328  Total interest given =  1600 +  1728  =  3328  Reeta asked whether the amount would be different for simple interest. The teacher  told her to find the  interest for two years and see for herself.  20000 8 2  × ×  SI for 2 years =     =  3200  100  Reeta said that when compound interest was used Heena would pay  128 more.  Let us look at the difference between simple interest and compound interest. We start  with  100. Try completing the chart.  Reprint 2024-25 \n",

      "ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND IDENTITIES    93  CHAPTER8  Algebraic Expressions  and Identities  8.1    Addition  and  Subtraction  of  Algebraic  Expressions  In earlier classes, we have already become familiar with what algebraic expressions  (or simply expressions) are. Examples of expressions are:  x + 3, 2y – 5, 3x2, 4xy + 7 etc.  In the earlier classes, we have also learnt how to add and subtract algebraic expressions.  For example, to add  7x2 – 4x + 5 and 9x – 10, we do  7x2 – 4x + 5  9x – 10  +  7x2 + 5x – 5  Observe how we do the addition. We write each expression to be added in a separate  row. While doing so we write like terms one below the other, and add them, as shown.  Thus 5 + (–10) = 5 –10 = –5. Similarly, – 4x + 9x = (– 4 + 9)x = 5x. Let us take some  more examples.  Example 1: Add: 7xy + 5yz – 3zx, 4yz + 9zx – 4y , –3xz + 5x – 2xy.  Solution: Writing the three expressions in separate rows, with like terms one below  the other, we have  7xy + 5yz –3zx  4yz +  9zx        – 4y  +  + –2xy  – 3zx + 5x  (Note xz is same as zx)  5xy  +  9yz + 3zx + 5x – 4y  Thus, the sum of the expressions is 5xy + 9yz + 3zx + 5x – 4y. Note how the terms, – 4y  in the second expression and 5x in the third expression, are carried over as they are,  since they have no like terms in the other expressions. \n",

Example 1: Add: 7xy + 5yz – 3zx, 4yz + 9zx – 4y , –3xz + 5x – 2xy.  Solution: Writing the three expressions in separate rows, with like terms one below  the other, we have  7xy + 5yz –3zx  4yz +  9zx        – 4y  +  + –2xy  – 3zx + 5x  (Note xz is same as zx)  5xy  +  9yz + 3zx + 5x – 4y \n",

[Hint: • Think of speed and time;  • Think of interest to be paid, the principal and the rate of simple interest; etc.]  In all the above examples, we had to carry out multiplication of two or more quantities. If  the quantities are given by algebraic expressions, we need to find their product. This  means that we should know how to obtain this product. Let us do this systematically. To  begin with we shall look at the multiplication of two monomials.  8.3    Multiplying  a  Monomial  by  a  Monomial  Expression that contains only one term is called a monomial.  8.3.1    Multiplying  two  monomials  We begin with  4 × x = x + x + x + x = 4x  as seen earlier.

While doing  so, we use the rules of exponents and powers.  8.3.2    Multiplying  three  or  more  monomials  Observe the following examples.  2x × 5y × 7z = (2x × 5y) × 7z = 10xy × 7z = 70xyz  (i)  4xy × 5x2y2 × 6x3y3 = (4xy × 5x2y2) × 6x3y3 = 20x3y3 × 6x3y3 = 120x3y3 × x3y3  (ii)  = 120 (x3 × x3) × (y3 × y3) = 120x6 × y6 = 120x6y6  It is clear that we first multiply the first two monomials and then multiply the resulting  monomial by the third monomial.

(b) Capacity refers to the quantity that a container holds.  Note: If a water tin holds 100 cm3 of water then the capacity of the water tin is 100 cm3.  Capacity is also measured in terms of litres. The relation between litre and cm3 is,  1 mL = 1 cm3,1 L = 1000 cm3. Thus, 1 m3 = 1000000 cm3 = 1000 L.  Example 8: Find the height of a cuboid whose volume is 275 cm3 and base area  is 25 cm2 .

Observe that as weight of sugar increases, cost also increases in such a manner that  their ratio remains constant.  Take one more example. Suppose a car uses 4 litres of petrol to travel a distance of  60 km. How far will it travel using 12 litres? The answer is 180 km. How did we calculate  it? Since petrol consumed in the second instance is 12 litres, i.e., three times of 4 litres, the  distance travelled will also be three times of 60 km. In other words, when the petrol  consumption becomes three-fold, the distance travelled is also three fold the previous  one. Let the consumption of petrol be x litres and the corresponding distance travelled be  y km . Now, complete the following table:  4  8  12  15  20  25  Petrol  in  litres  (x)  Distance  in  km  (y) 60  ...  180  ...  ...  ...  We find that as the value of x increases, value of y also increases in such a way that the  1  x   does not change; it remains constant (say k). In this case, it is   ratio    (check it!).  15  y  x  We say that x and y are in direct proportion, if   =   or x = ky.  k  y  4  12  =  In this example,   , where 4 and 12 are the quantities of petrol consumed in  60  180  litres (x) and 60 and 180 are the distances (y) in km. So when x and y are in direct  x  x  proportion, we can write  1  2  . [y1, y2 are values of y corresponding to the values x1,  =  y  y  1  2  x2 of x respectively]  The consumption of petrol and the distance travelled by a car is a case of direct  proportion.

Let us consider another example. A school wants to spend  6000 on mathematics  textbooks. How many books could be bought at  40 each? Clearly 150 books can be  bought. If the price of a textbook is more than  40, then the number of books which  could be purchased with the same amount of money would be less than 150. Observe the  following table.  40  50  60  75  80  100  Price of each book (in )  150  120  100  80  75  60  Number  of  books  that  can  be  bought  What do you observe? You will appreciate that as the price of the books increases,  the number of books that can be bought, keeping the fund constant, will decrease.  Ratio by which the price of books increases when going from 40 to 50 is 4 : 5, and the  ratio by which the corresponding number of books decreases from 150 to 120 is 5 : 4.  This means that the two ratios are inverses of each other.  Notice that the product of the corresponding values of the two quantities is constant;  that is, 40 × 150 = 50 × 120 = 6000.   If we represent the price of one book as x and the number of books bought as y, then  as x increases y decreases and vice-versa. It is important to note that the product xy  remains constant. We say that x varies inversely with y and y varies inversely with x. Thus  two quantities x and y are said to vary in inverse proportion, if there exists a relation  of the type xy = k between them, k being a constant. If  y1, y2 are the values of y  x  y  1  2  corresponding to the values x1, x2 of x respectively then x1y1 = x2y2 (= k), or   .  =  x  y  2  1  We say that x and y are in inverse proportion.  Hence, in this example, cost of a book and number of books purchased in a fixed  amount are inversely proportional. Similarly, speed of a vehicle and the time taken to  cover a fixed distance changes in inverse proportion.  Think of more such examples of pairs of quantities that vary in inverse proportion. You  may now have a look at the furniture – arranging problem, stated in the introductory part  of this chapter.  Here is an activity for better understanding of the inverse proportion.

Expressions like 3xy,   Their factors can be just read off from them, as we already know.  On the other hand consider expressions like 2x + 4, 3x + 3y, x2 + 5x, x2 + 5x + 6.  It is not obvious what their factors are. We need to develop systematic methods to factorise  these expressions, i.e., to find their factors. This is what we shall do now.  12.2.1    Method  of  common  factors  • We begin with a simple example: Factorise 2x + 4.  We shall write each term as a product of irreducible factors;  2x = 2 × x  4 = 2 × 2  2x + 4 = (2 × x) + (2 × 2)  Hence  Notice that factor 2 is common to both the terms.  Observe, by distributive law  2 × (x + 2) = (2 × x) + (2 × 2)  Therefore, we can write  2x + 4 = 2 × (x + 2) = 2 (x + 2)  Thus, the expression 2x + 4 is the same as 2 (x + 2).  Now we can read off its factors:  they are 2 and (x + 2). These factors are irreducible.  Next, factorise 5xy + 10x.  The irreducible factor forms of 5xy and 10x are respectively,  5xy = 5 × x × y  10x = 2 × 5 × x  Observe that the two terms have 5 and x as common factors.  Now,  5xy + 10x = (5 × x × y)  + (5 × x × 2)  = (5x × y)  + (5x × 2)  We combine the two terms using the distributive law,  (5x× y) + (5x× 2) = 5x × ( y + 2)  Therefore, 5xy + 10x = 5 x (y + 2). (This is the desired factor form.) \n",

      " MATHEMATICS  148   What  is  regrouping?  Suppose, the above expression was given as 2xy + 3 + 2y + 3x; then it will not be easy to  see the factorisation. Rearranging the expression, as 2xy + 2y + 3x + 3, allows us to form  groups (2xy + 2y) and (3x + 3) leading to factorisation. This is regrouping.  Regrouping may be possible in more than one ways. Suppose, we regroup the  expression as: 2xy + 3x + 2y + 3. This will also lead to factors. Let us try:  2xy + 3x + 2y + 3 = 2 × x × y + 3 × x + 2 × y + 3  = x × (2y + 3) + 1 × (2y + 3)             = (2y + 3) (x + 1)  The factors are the same (as they have to be), although they appear in different order.  Example 3: Factorise  6xy – 4y + 6 – 9x.  Solution:  Step 1  Check if there is a common factor among all terms.  There is none.  Step 2  Think of grouping.  Notice that first two terms have a common factor 2y;  6xy – 4y = 2y (3x – 2)  (a)  What about the last two terms? Observe them.  If you change their order to  – 9x + 6, the factor ( 3x – 2) will come out;  –9x + 6 = –3 (3x) + 3 (2)  = – 3 (3x – 2)  (b)  Step 3  Putting (a) and (b) together,  6xy – 4y + 6 – 9x = 6xy – 4y – 9x + 6  = 2y (3x – 2) – 3 (3x – 2)  = (3x – 2) (2y – 3)  The factors of (6xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x) are (3x – 2) and (2y – 3).

For example, in  x2 + 5x + 6, the term 6 is not a perfect square.  These expressions obviously also do not  fit the type (a2 – b2) either.  They, however, seem to be of the type x2 + (a + b) x + a b. We may therefore, try to  use Identity IV studied in the last chapter to factorise these expressions:  (x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a + b) x + ab  (IV)  For that we have to look at the coefficients of x and the constant term. Let us see how  it is done in the following example.  Example 9: Factorise x2 + 5x + 6  Solution:  If we compare the R.H.S. of Identity (IV) with x2 + 5x + 6, we find ab = 6,  and  a  +  b  =  5.  From  this,  we  must  obtain  a  and  b.  The  factors  then  will  be  (x + a) and (x + b).  If  a b  = 6, it means that a and b are factors of 6.  Let us try  a = 6, b = 1. For these  values a + b = 7, and not 5, So this choice is not right.  Let us try  a = 2, b = 3.  For this a + b = 5 exactly as required.  The factorised form of this given expression is then  (x +2) (x + 3).  In general, for factorising an algebraic expression of the type x2 + px + q, we find two  factors a and b of q (i.e., the constant term) such that  ab = q    and     a + b = p  x2 + (a + b) x + ab  Then, the expression becomes  x2 + ax + bx + ab  or  x(x + a) + b(x + a)  or  (x + a) (x + b)        which are the required factors.  or  Example 10: Find the factors of y2 –7y +12.  Solution:  We note 12 = 3 × 4 and 3 + 4 = 7.  Therefore,        y2 – 7y+ 12 = y2 – 3y – 4y + 12                            = y (y –3) – 4 (y –3)  = (y –3) (y – 4) \n",

      "FACTORISATION    151  Note, this time we did not compare the expression with that in Identity (IV) to identify  a and b.  After sufficient practice you may not need to compare the given expressions for  their factorisation with the expressions in the identities; instead you can proceed directly  as we did above.  Example 11: Obtain the factors of z2 – 4z – 12.  Solution: Here a b = –12 ; this means one of a  and b is negative. Further, a + b = – 4,  this means the one with larger numerical value is negative. We try a = – 4, b = 3; but  this will not work, since a + b = –1.  Next possible values are a = – 6, b = 2, so that  a + b = – 4 as required.  z2  – 4z –12 = z2  – 6z + 2z –12  Hence,  = z(z – 6) + 2(z – 6 )  = (z – 6) (z + 2)  Example 12: Find the factors of 3m2 + 9m +  6.  Solution: We notice that 3 is a common factor of all the terms.  3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m2 + 3m + 2)  Therefore,  m 2 + 3m + 2 = m2 + m + 2m + 2  Now,  (as 2 = 1 × 2)  = m(m + 1)+ 2( m + 1)                    = (m + 1) (m + 2)  3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m + 1) (m + 2)  Therefore,  EXERCISE  12.2  1.

We also know how to  multiply two expressions. We have not however, looked at division of one algebraic  expression by another. This is what we wish to do in this section.  We recall that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Thus, 7 × 8 = 56 gives  56 ÷ 8 = 7 or 56 ÷ 7 = 8.  We may similarly follow the division of algebraic expressions. For example,  2x × 3x2 = 6x3  (i)  6x3 ÷ 2x = 3x2  Therefore,  6x3 ÷ 3x2 = 2x.  and also,  5x (x + 4) = 5x2 + 20x  (ii)  (5x2 + 20x) ÷ 5x = x + 4  Therefore,  (5x2 + 20x) ÷ (x + 4) = 5x.  and also  We shall now look closely at how the division of one expression by another can be  carried out. To begin with we shall consider the division of a monomial by another monomial.  12.3.1    Division  of  a  monomial  by  another  monomial  Consider  6x3 ÷ 2x  We may write 2x and 6x3 in irreducible factor forms,  2x = 2 × x  6x3 = 2 × 3 × x × x × x  Now we group factors of 6x3 to separate 2x,  6x3 = 2 × x × (3 × x × x) = (2x) × (3x2)  6x3 ÷ 2x = 3x2.  Therefore,  A shorter way to depict cancellation of common factors is as we do in division of numbers:  77  7 11  ×  77 ÷ 7 =   =   = 11  7  7  36  x  6x3 ÷ 2x =  Similarly,  x  2  x  x  x  2  3  × × × ×   = 3 × x × x = 3x2  =  x  2  ×  Example 13: Do the following divisions.  (i) –20x4 ÷ 10x2  (ii) 7x2y2z2 ÷ 14xyz  Solution:  (i) –20x4 = –2 × 2 × 5 × x × x × x × x    10x2 = 2 × 5 × x × x \n",

      "“Captain Jim Macpherson,” I replied. “And a Happy  Christmas to you too. I’m a school teacher from Dorset,  in the west of England.”  “Ah, Dorset,” he smiled. “I know this place. I know it  very well.” We shared my rum ration and his excellent  sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke  almost  perfect  English.  But  it  turned  out  that  he  had  never  set  foot  in  Dorset,  never  even  been  to  England.  He  had  learned  all  he  knew  of  England  from  school,  and from reading books in English. His favourite writer  was  Thomas  Hardy,  his  favourite  book  Far  from  the  Madding Crowd. So out there in no man’s land we talked  of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and  Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months  ago. As I looked about me there were huddles of khaki  and grey everywhere, all over no man’s land, smoking,  laughing,  talking,  drinking,  eating.

Hans  Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands  and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as  anything.  There  was  a  moment  when  I  noticed  our  breaths  mingling  in  the  air  between  us.  He  saw  it  too  and  smiled.  “Jim  Macpherson,”  he  said  after  a  while,  “I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football  match. No one dies in a football match. No children are  orphaned. No wives become widows.”  “I’d  prefer  cricket,”  I  told  him.  “Then  we  Tommies  could  be  sure  of  winning,  probably.”  We  laughed  at  that, and together we watched the game.

      "Connie, Fritz won, two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf  generously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it  wasn’t quite fair.  The time came, and all too soon, when the game was  finished,  the  schnapps  and  the  rum  and  the  sausage  had  long  since  run  out,  and  we  knew  it  was  all  over.  I wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see  his family again soon, that the fighting would end and  we could all go home.  “I  think  that  is  what  every  soldier  wants,  on  both  sides,”  Hans  Wolf  said.  “Take  care,  Jim  Macpherson.  I shall never forget this moment, nor you.” He saluted  and  walked  away  from  me  slowly,  unwillingly,  I  felt.  He turned to wave just once and then became one of  the hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards  their trenches.

      "Even when getting down from the summit, once the  physical  exhaustion  had  gone,  I  began  asking  myself  exhaustion:  fatigue;  the question why I had climbed Everest. Why did the  tiredness  act  of  reaching  the  summit  have  such  a  hold  on  my  imagination?  It  was  already  a  thing  of  the  past,  something done yesterday. With every passing day, it  would  become  more  remote.  And  then  what  would  remain? Would my memories fade slowly away?  All these thoughts led me to question myself as  to  why  people  climb  mountains.  It  is  not  easy  to  answer the question. The simplest answer would be,  as others have said, “Because it is there.” It presents  great difficulties. Man takes delight in overcoming  obstacles. The obstacles in climbing a mountain are  physical.  A  climb  to  a  summit  means  endurance,  persistence  and  will  power.  The  demonstration  of  these physical qualities is no doubt exhilarating, as  it was for me also.  I have a more personal answer to the question. From  exhilarating:  my  childhood  I  have  been  attracted  by  mountains.  I  very exciting  had been miserable, lost, when away from mountains,  communion:  state or feeling  in the plains. Mountains are nature at its best. Their  beauty  and  majesty  pose  a  great  challenge,  and  like  many,  I  believe  that  mountains  are  a  means  of  communion with God.  Once having granted this, the question remains: Why  Everest?  Because  it  is  the  highest,  the  mightiest  and  of close rela-  has  defied  many  previous  attempts.

Once taken up, it cannot be given up halfway  resisted  even when one’s life is at stake. The passage back is as  difficult as the passage onwards. And then, when the  summit is climbed, there is the exhilaration, the joy of  having  done  something,  the  sense  of  a  battle  fought  and won. There is a feeling of victory and of happiness.

      "Before you read  This is the story of a meeting between two extraordinary  people, both of them ‘disabled’, or ‘differently abled’ as  we now say. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest  scientists of our time. He suffers from a form of paralysis  that confines him to a wheelchair, and allows him to  ‘speak’ only by punching buttons on a computer, which  speaks for him in a machine-like voice. Firdaus Kanga  is  a  writer  and  journalist  who  lives  and  works  in  Mumbai.  Kanga  was  born  with  ‘brittle  bones’  that  tended  to  break  easily  when  he  was  a  child.

      "Before you read  This is the story of a meeting between two extraordinary  people, both of them ‘disabled’, or ‘differently abled’ as  we now say. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest  scientists of our time. He suffers from a form of paralysis  that confines him to a wheelchair, and allows him to  ‘speak’ only by punching buttons on a computer, which  speaks for him in a machine-like voice. Firdaus Kanga  is  a  writer  and  journalist  who  lives  and  works  in  Mumbai.  Kanga  was  born  with  ‘brittle  bones’  that  tended  to  break  easily  when  he  was  a  child.

      "the author of A Brief History of Time, one of  the biggest best-sellers ever, lived here.  When the walking tour was done, I rushed  to a phone booth and, almost tearing the cord  so it could reach me outside, phoned Stephen  Hawking’s house. There was his assistant on  the  line  and  I  told  him  I  had  come  in  a  wheelchair from India (perhaps he thought I  had  propelled  myself  all  the  way)  to  write  about  my  travels  in  Britain.  I  had  to  see  Professor Hawking — even ten minutes would  do. “Half an hour,“ he said. “From three-thirty  to four.”  And  suddenly  I  felt  weak  all  over.  Growing  up  disabled, you get fed up with people asking you to be  brave, as if you have a courage account on which you  are  too  lazy  to  draw  a  cheque.  The  only  thing  that  makes  you  stronger  is  seeing  somebody  like  you,  achieving something huge. Then you know how much  is possible and you reach out further than you ever  thought you could.  “I  haven’t  been  brave,”  said  his  disembodied  computer-voice, the next afternoon. “I’ve had no choice.”  Surely,  I  wanted  to  say,  living  creatively  with  the  reality  of  his  disintegrating  body  was  a  choice?  But  I  kept  quiet,  because  I  felt  guilty  every  time  I  spoke  to  him, forcing him to respond. There he was, tapping at  the little switch in his hand, trying to find the words on  his computer with the only bit of movement left to him,  his  long,  pale  fingers.  Every  so  often,  his  eyes  would  shut in frustrated exhaustion. And sitting opposite him  buoyant:  intensely  I could feel his anguish, the mind buoyant with thoughts  active and  that came out in frozen phrases and sentences stiff as  vibrant  corpses.  “A lot of people seem to think that disabled people  are chronically unhappy,” I said. “I know that’s not true  myself.

      "About three minutes later, he responded, “I find it  amusing when people patronise me.”  “And do you find it annoying when someone like me  comes and disturbs you in your work?”  The answer flashed. “Yes.” Then he smiled his one-  way  smile  and  I  knew,  without  being  sentimental  or  silly,  that  I  was  looking  at  one  of  the  most  beautiful  men in the world.  A first glimpse of him is shocking, because he is like a  still  photograph  —  as  if  all  those  pictures  of  him  in  magazines and newspapers have turned three-dimensional.

In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In    fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.  In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores    called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of  glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings. \n",

      "7  Transportation in  Animals  and  Plants  You  have  learnt  earlier  that  all  organisms need food, water and  oxygen for survival. They need to  transport  all  these  to  various  parts  of  their  body.  Further,  animals  need  to  transport  wastes  to  parts  from  where  they  can  be  removed.  Have  you  wondered how all this is achieved? Look  Heart  at  Fig.  7.1.  Do  you  see  the  heart  and  the  blood  vessels?  They  function  to  Vein  transport substances and together form  the circulatory system.

Blood  flows  out.  But  what  is  blood?  Blood  is  the  fluid  which  flows  in  blood  vessels.  It  transports  substances like digested food from the  small intestine to the other parts of the  body. It carries oxygen from the lungs  to the cells of the body. It also transports  waste for removal from the body.  How  does  the  blood  carry  various  substances?  Blood  is  composed  of  a  fluid,  called  plasma  in  which  different  types of cells are suspended.  Why is the colour of  Fig. 7.1  Circulatory system  blood red ?

Fig. 9.1  Vehicles moving in the same  The most convenient way to  direction on a road  find  out  which  of  the  two  or  more objects is moving faster  is  to  compare  the  distances  moved by them in a unit time.  Thus, if we know the distance  covered  by  two  buses  in  one  hour, we can tell which one is  faster.  We  call  the  distance  covered by an object in a unit  time as the speed of the object.  When we say that a car is  moving  with  a  speed  of  50  kilometres per hour, it implies  that it will cover a distance of  Fig. 9.2  Position of vehicles shown in  50 kilometres in one hour.

      "The  Indian  Constitution  Chapter 1  In  this  chapter,  we  are  going  to  begin  with  football,  a  game  many  of  you  have  probably  heard  of,  or  even  played. As the name suggests, this is a game that involves  the  players’  feet.  According  to  the  rules  of  football,  if  the  ball  touches  the  arm  of  any  player  (except  the  goalkeeper), then this is considered a foul. So if players  start holding the football in their hands and passing it  around,  then  they  are  not  playing  football  any  more.  Similarly  other  games,  such  as  hockey  or  cricket,  also  have rules according to which they are played. Each of  these  rules  helps  define  the  game,  and  helps  us  distinguish  one  game  from  another.  As  these  are  fundamental  to  the  game,  we  can  also  call  them  the  constitutive  rules  of  the  game.  Like  these  games,  a  society also has constitutive rules that make it what it  is  and  differentiate  it  from  other  kinds  of  societies.  In  large societies in which different communities of people  live  together,  these  rules  are  formulated  through  consensus,  and  in  modern  countries  this  consensus  is  usually  available  in  written  form.  A  written  document  in which we find such rules is called a Constitution.  We have looked at the Indian Constitution in Classes VI  and  VII  in  our  Social and Political Life  textbooks.  Have  you ever wondered why we need a Constitution or been  curious about how the Constitution got written, or who  wrote  it?  In  this  chapter,  we  will  discuss  both  these  issues  and  also  look  at  the  key  features  of  the  Indian  Constitution.  Each  of  these  features  is  crucial  to  the  working  of  democracy  in  India  and  some  of  these  will  be the focus of different chapters in this book.  4  Social  and  Political  Life \n",

Today  most  countries  in  the  world  have  a  Constitution.  While  all  democratic  countries  are  likely  to  have  a  Constitution, it is not necessary that all countries that have  a  Constitution  are  democratic.  The  Constitution  serves  several  purposes.  First,  it  lays  out  certain  ideals  that  form  the basis of the kind of country that we as citizens aspire to  live  in.  Or,  put  another  way,  a  Constitution  tells  us  what  the  fundamental  nature  of  our  society  is.  A  country  is  usually  made  up  of  different  communities  of  people  who  share  certain  beliefs  but  may  not  necessarily  agree  on  all  issues.  A  Constitution  helps  serve  as  a  set  of  rules  and  principles  that  all  persons  in  a  country  can  agree  upon  as  the basis of the way in which they want the country to be  governed.  This  includes  not  only  the  type  of  government  but also an agreement on certain ideals that they all believe  the  country  should  uphold.  5  Chapter 1: The Indian Constitution \n",

      "earlier Constitution stated that the country was to be ruled by  the King and his council of  ministers. In countries that have  adopted  a  democratic  form  of   government  or  polity,  the  Constitution plays a crucial role in laying out certain important  guidelines that govern decision-making within these societies.  In a democracy, we choose our leaders so that they can exercise  power responsibly on our behalf. However, there is always the  possibility that these leaders might misuse their authority and  the Constitution usually provides safeguards against this.

This  may  sound  strange  but  what is meant by this is that we might at times feel  strongly  about  an  issue  that  might  go  against  our  larger  interests  and  the  Constitution  helps  us  guard  against  this.  Look  at  the  storyboard  below  to  understand  this  better:  Shabnam is in a fix. She has a decision to make.  I  have  two  chapters  left  to  revise  for  Shabnam,  why  tomorrow’s  test.

For  example,  it  is  possible  that  many  people  who  live  in  a  democracy  might  come  to  strongly  feel  that  party  politics  has  become  so  acrimonious  that  we  need  a  strong  dictator  to  set  this  right.  Swept  by  this  emotion,  they  may  not  realise  that  in  the  long  run,  dictatorial  rule  goes  against  all  their  interests.

It does  not  allow  for  the  easy  overthrow  of  provisions  that  guarantee  rights  of  citizens  and  protect  their  freedom.

Now let us try and understand the ways in which the above  points  get  translated  into  certain  ideals  and  rules  by  studying  some  key  features  of  the  Indian  Constitution.  The Indian Constitution: Key Features  By  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  Indian  national  movement  had  been  active  in  the  struggle  for  independence from British rule for several decades. During  the  freedom  struggle  the  nationalists  had  devoted  a  great  deal  of  time  to  imagining  and  planning  what  a  free  India  would  be  like.  Under  the  British,  they  had  been  forced  to  obey  rules  that  they  had  had  very  little  role  in  making.  The long experience of authoritarian rule under the colonial  state  convinced  Indians  that  free  India  should  be  a  democracy  in  which  everyone  should  be  treated  equally  and  be  allowed  to  participate  in  government.

The  country  was  made  up  of  several  different  communities  who  spoke  different  languages,  belonged  to  different  religions,  and  had  distinct  cultures.  Also,  when  the  Constitution  was  being  written,  India  was  going  through  considerable  turmoil.

      "Constitution  of  India  guarantees  universal  adult  suffrage  for  all  citizens.  When  they  were  making  the  Constitution,  the  members  of  the  Constituent  Assembly  felt  that  the  freedom struggle had prepared the masses for universal adult  suffrage  and  that  this  would  help  encourage  a  democratic  mindset  and  break  the  clutches  of  traditional  caste,  class  and gender hierarchies. This  means that the people of India  have  a  direct  role  in  electing  their  representatives.  Also,  every  citizen  of  the  country,  irrespective  of  his/her  social  background,  can  also  contest  in  elections.  These  representatives are accountable to the people. You will read  more  about  why  representation  is  crucial  to  democratic  functioning in Unit 2 of this book.  3. Separation of Powers:  According to the Constitution, there  are three organs of government. These are the legislature, the  executive and the judiciary. The legislature refers to our elected  representatives. The executive is a smaller group of  people who  are  responsible  for  implementing  laws  and  running  the  government.

      "5.  Secularism: A secular state is one in which the state does  not officially promote any one religion as the state religion.  We will read more about this in the following chapter.  You now understand the ways in which a country’s history  often determines the kind of  Constitution that a country  adopts for itself.  The Constitution plays a crucial role in laying  out the ideals that we would like all citizens of the country to  adhere to, including the representatives that we elect to rule  us. Just like in the game of  football, a change of  constitutive  rules  will  affect  the  game.  Indian  Constitution  has  been  amended over the years to reflect new concerns of  the polity.  Often a major change in the Constitution means a change in  the fundamental nature of  the country. We saw this in the case  of  Nepal  and  how  it  needed  to  adopt  a  new  Constitution after it became a democracy.  The  different  features  of  the  Indian  Constitution  outlined above, involve complicated ideas that are  often  not  easy  to  grasp.  Don’t  worry  too  much  about this for the moment. In the rest of the book  as  well  as  in  your  higher  classes,    you  will  read  more  about  these  different  features  of  the  Indian  Constitution  and  understand  more  substantively  what they mean.

      "Why is it Important to Separate Religion  from the State?  As discussed above, the most important aspect of secularism  is  its  separation  of  religion  from  State  power.  This  is  important for a country to function democratically. Almost  all countries of the world will have more than one religious  group  living  in  them.  Within  these  religious  groups,  there  will  most  likely  be  one  group  that  is  in  a  majority.  If  this  majority religious group has access to State power, then it  could quite easily use this power and financial resources to  discriminate  against  and  persecute  persons  of  other  religions.  This  tyranny  of  the  majority  could  result  in  the  discrimination,  coercion  and  at  times  even  the  killing  of  religious  minorities.

Therefore, the tyranny  of  the  majority  and  the  violation  of  Fundamental  Rights  that can result is one reason why it is important to separate  the  State  and  religion  in  democratic  societies.  Another  reason  that  it  is  important  to  separate  religion  from  the  State  in  democratic  societies  is  because  we  also  need  to  protect  the  freedom  of  individuals  to  exit  from  their religion, embrace another religion or have the freedom  to  interpret  religious  teachings  differently.  To  understand  this point better, let us take the practice of untouchability.  You  might  feel  that  you  dislike  this  practice  within  Hinduism  and  therefore,  you  want  to  try  and  reform  it.  However, if State power were in the hands of those Hindus  who  support  untouchability,  then  do  you  think  that  you  would have an easy task to try and change this? Even if you  were part of the dominant religious group, you might face  a  lot  of  resistance  from  fellow  members  of  your  community.

The Indian Constitution mandates that the Indian State be  secular. According to the Constitution, only a secular State  can  realise  its  objectives  to  ensure  the  following:  1. that  one  religious  community  does  not  dominate  another;  2. that some members do not dominate other members of  the  same  religious  community;  3. that  the  State  does  not  enforce  any  particular  religion  nor  take  away  the  religious  freedom  of  individuals.  The Indian State works in various ways to prevent the above  domination. First, it uses a strategy of distancing itself from  religion. The Indian State is not ruled by a religious group  and  nor  does  it  support  any  one  religion.  In  India,  government  spaces  like  law  courts,  police  stations,  government schools and offices are not supposed to display  or  promote  any  one  religion.  21  Chapter  2:  Understanding  Secularism \n",

      "the  same  religion  (‘upper-caste’  Hindus)  dominate  other  members  (some  ‘lower  castes’)  within  it.  In  order  to  prevent  this  religion-based  exclusion  and  discrimination  of  ‘lower  castes’,  the  Indian  Constitution  bans  untouchability.  In  this  instance,  the  State  is  intervening  in  religion  in  order  to  end  a  social  practice  that  it  believes  discriminates  and  excludes,  and  that  violates  the  Fundamental  Rights  of  ‘lower  castes’  who  are  citizens  of  this country. Similarly, to ensure that laws relating to equal  inheritance  rights  are  respected,  the  State  may  have  to  intervene  in  the  religion-based  ‘personal  laws’  of  communities.  The  intervention  of  the  State  can  also  be  in  the  form  of  support.

      "Indian Constitution intervened in Hindu religious practices  in order to abolish untouchability. In Indian secularism,  though the State is not strictly separate from religion it  does maintain a principled distance vis-à-vis religion. This  means that any interference in religion by the State has to  be based on the ideals laid out in the Constitution. These  ideals serve as the standard through which we can judge  whether the State is or is not behaving according to secular  principles.

This  law  has  encountered  a  lot  of  resistance  from  immigrants  who  are  mainly  from  the  former  French  colonies  of  Algeria,  Tunisia  and  Morocco.

But they faced grave danger if  they  tried  to  criticise  these  decisions.  The  freedom  movement  changed  this  situation.  The  nationalists  began  to  openly  criticise  the  British  government  and  make  demands.

How does the individual give approval to the government? One  way of  doing so, as you read, is through elections. People would  elect their representatives to the Parliament, then, one group  from among these elected representatives forms the government.  The Parliament, which is made up of  all representatives together,  controls and guides the government. In this sense people, through  their chosen representatives, form the government and also  control it.

The other ministries of the Union Government are located in various  buildings in New Delhi.  The  Rajya  Sabha  functions  primarily  as  the  representative  of  the  states  of  India  in  the  Parliament.  The  Rajya  Sabha  can  also  initiate  legislation  and  a  bill  is  required  to  pass  through  the  Rajya  Sabha  in  order  to  become  a  law.  It,  therefore,  has  an  important  role  of  reviewing  and  altering  (if  alterations  are  needed)  the  laws  initiated  by  the  Lok  Sabha.

The question hour is an important mechanism through which  MPs  can  elicit  information  about  the  working  of  the  government.  This  is  a  very  important  way  through  which  the  Parliament  controls  the  executive.  By  asking  questions  the government is alerted to its shortcomings, and also comes  to  know  the  opinion  of  the  people  through  their  representatives  in  the  Parliament,  i.e.  the  MPs.  Asking  questions of the government is a crucial task for every MP.  The  Opposition  parties  play  a  critical  role  in  the  healthy  functioning  of  a  democracy.

      "Chapter 4  Judiciary  A glance at the newspaper provides you a glimpse of  the range of work done by the courts in this country.  But  can  you  think  of  why  we  need  these  courts?  In India we have the rule of law. What this means is  that  laws  apply  equally  to  all  persons  and  that  a  certain set of fixed procedures need to be followed  when  a  law  is  violated.  To  enforce  this  rule  of  law,  we  have  a  judicial  system  that  consists  of  the  mechanism  of  courts  that  a  citizen  can  approach  when a law is violated. As an organ of government,  the  judiciary  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  functioning  of India’s democracy. It can play this role only because  it  is  independent.  What  does  an  ‘independent  judiciary’  mean?  Is  there  any  connection  between  the  court  in  your  area  and  the  Supreme  Court  in  New Delhi?

      "y  r  a  i  c  i  d  u  J  What is the Role of the Judiciary?  Courts  take  decisions  on  a  very  large  number  of  issues.  They can decide that no teacher can beat a student, or about  the sharing of river waters between states, or they can punish  people  for  particular  crimes.  Broadly  speaking,  the  work  that  the  judiciary  does  can  be  divided  into  the  following:  Dispute Resolution: The judicial system provides a mechanism  for resolving disputes between citizens, between citizens and  the government, between two state governments and between  the centre and state governments.  Judicial Review: As the final interpreter of the Constitution,  the judiciary also has the power to strike down particular laws  passed by the Parliament if  it believes that these are a violation  of  the basic structure of  the Constitution. This is called judicial  review.  Upholding the Law and Enforcing Fundamental Rights:  Every citizen of India can approach the Supreme Court or the  High Court if they believe that their Fundamental Rights have  been violated.  Supreme Court of India  https://www.sci.gov.in  The Supreme Court was established on  26 January 1950, the day India became a  Republic. Like its predecessor, the Federal Court  of  India  (1937–1949),  it  was  earlier  located  in  the Chamber of Princes in the Parliament House.

Why  not?  the Indian Constitution protects against this kind of situation  by providing for the independence of  the judiciary.  One aspect of this independence is the ‘separation of powers’.  This,  as  you  read  in  Chapter  1,  is  a  key  feature  of   the  Constitution.  What  this  means  here  is  that  other  branches  of government – the legislature and the executive – cannot  interfere in the work of  the judiciary. The courts are not under  the government and do not act on their behalf.  For the above separation to work well, it is also crucial that all  judges in the High Court as well as the Supreme Court are  appointed with very little interference from these other branches  of government. Once appointed to this office, it is also very  difficult to remove a judge.  50  Social  and  Political  Life \n",

The  courts  that  most  people  interact  with  are  what  are  called  subordinate  or  district  courts. These are usually at the district or Tehsil level or in  towns  and  they  hear  many  kinds  of  cases.  Each  state  is  divided  into  districts  that  are  presided  over  by  a  District  Judge.  Each  state  has  a  High  Court  which  is  the  highest  court of that state.

Yes, they are. In India, we have an integrated judicial system,  meaning that the decisions made by higher courts are binding  on the lower courts. Another way to understand this integration  is through the appellate system that exists in India. This means  that a person can appeal to a higher court if they believe that  the judgment passed by the lower court is not just.  Let us understand what we mean by the appellate system by  tracking a case, State (Delhi Administration) vs Laxman Kumar  and Others (1985), from the lower courts to the Supreme Court.

They stated that on the night of  December 1,  they had heard Sudha scream and had forced their way into  Laxman’s flat. There they saw Sudha standing with her sari in  flames. They extinguished the fire by wrapping Sudha in a gunny  bag and a blanket. Sudha told them that her mother-in-law  Shakuntala had poured kerosene oil on her and that her husband  Laxman had lit the fire. During the trial, members of  Sudha’s  family and a neighbour stated that Sudha had been subjected  to torture by her in-laws and that they were demanding more  High Court of Karnataka  cash, a scooter and a fridge on the birth of the first child.

On  the basis of  this and other evidence, the Trial Court convicted  Laxman, his mother Shakuntala and his brother-in-law Subash  Chandra and sentenced all three of them to death.

      "Does Everyone Have Access to the Courts?  In  principle,  all  citizens  of  India  can  access  the  courts  in  this  country.  This  implies  that  every  citizen  has  a  right  to  justice  through  the  courts.  As  you  read  earlier,  the  courts  play  a  very  significant  role  in  protecting  our  Fundamental  Rights.  If  any  citizen  believes  that  their  rights  are  being  violated, then they can approach the court for justice to be   1  done. While the courts are available for all, in reality access  to courts has always been difficult for a vast majority of the  poor in India. Legal procedures involve a lot of money and  paperwork as well as take up a lot of time. For a poor person  who cannot read and whose family depends on a daily wage,  the idea of going to court to get justice often seems remote.  In  response  to  this,  the  Supreme  Court  in  the  early  1980s  devised  a  mechanism  of  Public  Interest  Litigation  or  PIL   2  to  increase  access  to  justice.  It  allowed  any  individual  or  organisation to file a PIL in the High Court or the Supreme  Court on behalf of those whose rights were being violated.  The  legal  process  was  greatly  simplified  and  even  a  letter  or  telegram  addressed  to  the  Supreme  Court  or  the  High  Court could be treated as a PIL. In the early years, PIL was  used  to  secure  justice  on  a  large  number  of  issues  such  as  rescuing bonded labourers from inhuman work conditions;   3  and securing the release of prisoners in Bihar who had been  kept in jail even after their punishment term was complete.  Did  you  know  that  the  mid-day  meal  that  children  now  receive  in  government  and  government-aided  schools  is  because of a PIL? See the photos on the right and read the  text  below  to  understand  how  this  came  about.   4  Photo 1. In 2001, the drought in Rajasthan and Orissa meant that millions faced an acute shortage of food.  Photo 2. Meanwhile the government godowns were full of grain. Often this was being eaten away by rats.  Photo 3. In this situation of ‘hunger amidst plenty’ an organisation called the People’s Union of Civil Liberties or PUCL filed a PIL in the Supreme  Court.  It  stated  that  the  fundamental  Right  to  Life  guaranteed  in  Article  21  of  the  Constitution  included  the  Right  to  Food.  The  state’s  excuse  that  it did not have adequate funds was shown to be wrong because the godowns were overflowing with grains. The Supreme Court ruled that the State  had a duty to provide food to all.  Photo 4. It, therefore, directed the government to provide more employment, to provide food at cheaper prices through the government ration shops,  and to provide mid-day meals to children. It also appointed two Food Commissioners to report on the implementation of government schemes.  55  Chapter 4: Judiciary \n",

      "For the common person, access to courts is access to justice.  The  courts  exercise  a  crucial  role  in  interpreting  the  Fundamental Rights of citizens and as you saw in the above  case,  the  courts  interpreted  Article  21  of  the  Constitution  on  the  Right  to  Life  to  include  the  Right  to  Food.  They,  therefore, ordered the State to take certain steps to provide  food for all including the mid-day meal scheme.  However, there are also court judgments that people believe  work against the best interests of the common person. For  example, activists who work on issues concerning the right  to shelter and housing for the poor believe that the recent  judgments on evictions are a far cry from earlier judgments.  While  recent  judgments  tend  to  view  the  slum  dweller  as  an  encroacher  in  the  city,  earlier  judgments  (like  the  1985  Olga  Tellis  vs  Bombay  Municipal  Corporation)  had  tried  to  protect  the  livelihoods  of  slum  dwellers.  The  judgment  of  the  Olga  Tellis  vs  Bombay  Municipal  Corporation  established  the  Right  to  Livelihood  as  part  of  the  Right  to  Life.  The  following  excerpts  from  the  judgment  point  to  the  ways  in  which  the  judges  linked  the  issue  of  the  Right  to  Life  to  that  of  livelihood:  The sweep of the Right to Life, conferred by Article 21 is wide and far reaching. ‘Life’  means  something  more  than  mere  animal  existence.  It  does  not  mean  merely  that  life  cannot  be  extinguished  or  taken  away  as,  for  example,  by  the  imposition  and  execution  of  the  death  sentence,  except  according  to  procedure  established  by  law.  That  is  but  one  aspect of the Right to Life. An equally important facet of that right is the right to  livelihood  because  no  person  can  live  without  the  means  of  living,  that  is,  the  means  of  livelihood.  That the eviction of a person from a pavement or slum will inevitably lead to the  deprivation  of  his  means  of  livelihood,  is  a  proposition  which  does  not  have  to  be  established  in  each  individual  case  ….  In  the  present  case  that  facts  constituting  empirical  evidence  justify  the  conclusion  that  the  petitioners  live  in  slums  and  on  pavements  because  they  have  small  jobs  to  nurse  in  the  city  and  for  them  there  is  nowhere else to live. They choose a pavement or a slum in the vicinity of their place of  work  and  to  loose  the  pavement  or  the  slum  is  to  loose  the  job.  The  conclusion  therefore  is  that  the  eviction  of  the  petitioners  will  lead  to  deprivation  of  their  livelihood  and  consequently  to  the  deprivation  of  life.

      "Understanding  Chapter 5  Marginalisation  What Does it Mean to be Socially Marginalised?  To be marginalised is to be forced to occupy the sides or fringes and thus not be at the  centre of things.  This is something that some of you have probably experienced in the  classroom or playground. If you are not like most people in your class, that is, if your  taste in music or films is different, if your accent marks you out from others, if you are  less  chatty  than  others  in  your  class,  if  you  don’t  play  the  same  sport  that  many  of  your  classmates  like,  if  you  dress  differently,  the  chances  are  that  you  will  not  be  considered to be ‘in’ by your peers. So, often, you end up feeling that you are ‘not with  it’ – as if what you say, feel and think and how you act are not quite right or acceptable  to others.  As in the classroom, in the social environment too, groups of people or communities  may have the experience of being excluded. Their marginalisation can be because they  speak a different language, follow different customs or belong to a different religious  group from the majority community. They may also feel marginalised because they are  poor,  considered  to  be  of  ‘low’  social  status  and  viewed  as  being  less  human  than  others. Sometimes, marginalised groups are viewed with hostility and fear. This sense  of difference and exclusion leads to communities not having access to resources and  opportunities and in their inability to assert their rights.  They experience a sense of  disadvantage  and  powerlessness  vis-a-vis  more  powerful  and  dominant  sections  of  society  who  own  land,  are  wealthy,  better  educated  and  politically  powerful.  Thus,  marginalisation  is  seldom  experienced  in  one  sphere.  Economic,  social,  cultural  and  political factors work together to make certain groups in society feel marginalised.  In this chapter, you will read about two communities that are considered to be socially  marginalised  in  India  today.  62  Social  and  Political  Life \n",

Niyamgiri is the sacred mountain of  this community. A major aluminium company is  planning to set up a mine and a refinery here  which will displace this Adivasi community.  They have strongly resisted this proposed  development  and  have  been  joined  by  environmentalists as well. A case against the  company is also pending in the Supreme Court.  Forest lands have been cleared for timber and to get land  for agriculture and industry. Adivasis have also lived in  areas that are rich in minerals and other natural resources.  These are taken over for mining and other large industrial  projects. Powerful forces have often colluded to take over  tribal  land.  Much  of  the  time,  the  land  is  taken  away  forcefully and procedures are not followed. According to  official figures, more than 50 per cent of persons displaced  due to mines and mining projects are tribals. Another recent  survey report by organisations working among Adivasis  shows that 79 per cent of the persons displaced from the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Chhattisgarh,  Odisha  and  Jharkhand are tribals.

This  social marginalization of Muslims in some instances has led  to them migrating from places where they have lived, often  leading to the ghettoisation of the community. Sometimes,  this prejudice has also led to hatred and violence.

(page  75)  Yet, the lives of marginalised people can and do change.  Thus, no one is marginalised all the time in exactly the same  way. If we go back to the two examples of marginalisation  we have discussed, we will see that each of these groups has  a  long  history  of  struggle  and  resistance.  Marginalised  communities want to maintain their cultural distinctiveness  while  having  access  to  rights,  development  and  other  opportunities. In the next chapter, we will read about how  different groups have confronted marginalisation.  72  Social  and  Political  Life \n",

      "Confronting  Chapter 6  Marginalisation  In  the  previous  chapter,  we  read  about  two  different  groups  and  their  experiences  of  inequality  and  discrimination.  Though  powerless,  such  groups  have  fought, protested and struggled against being excluded  or  dominated  by  others.  They  have  attempted  to  overcome  their  situation  by  adopting  a  range  of  strategies in their long history. Religious solace, armed  struggle,  self  improvement  and  education,  economic  uplift – there appears to be no one way of doing things.  In  all  cases,  the  choice  of  struggle  has  depended  on  the  circumstances  that  the  marginalised  find  themselves  in.  In this chapter, we will read about some of the ways in  which  groups  and  individuals  challenge  existing  inequalities. Adivasis, Dalits, Muslims, women and other  marginal groups argue that simply by being citizens of  a  democratic  country,  they  possess  equal  rights  that  must be respected. Many among them look up to the  Constitution  to  address  their  concerns.  In  this  chapter,  we  will  see  why  the  Constitution  of  India  is  something  that  marginalised  groups  invoke  in  the  course of their struggles. As part of this, we will look  at how rights are translated into laws to protect groups  from  continued  exploitation  and  we  will  also  look  at  the  government’s  efforts  to  formulate  policies  to  promote the access of these groups to development.  74  Social  and  Political  Life \n",

      "Adivasi Demands and the 1989 Act  The  1989  Act  is  important  for  another  reason  –  Adivasi  activists  refer  to  it  to  defend  their  right  to  occupy  land  that  was  traditionally  theirs.  As  you  read  in  the  previous  chapter  Adivasis  are  often  unwilling  to  move  from  their  land  and  are  forcibly  displaced.  Activists  have  asked  that  those  who  have  forcibly  encroached  upon  tribal  lands  should be punished under this law. They have also pointed  to  the  fact  that  this  Act  merely  confirms  what  has  already  been  promised  to  tribal  people  in  the  Constitution  –  that  land belonging to tribal people cannot be sold to or bought  by non-tribal people. In cases where this has happened, the  Constitution  guarantees  the  right  of  tribal  people  to  re-possess their land.  C.K. Janu, an Adivasi activist, has also pointed out that one  of the violators of Constitutional rights guaranteed to tribal  The  central  government  passed  the  Scheduled  people are governments in the various states of India – for it  Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers  (Recognition  of  Forest  Rights)  Act,  2006.

After  all,  governments  spend  large  sums  of  money  on  building  industrial or other projects on lands taken from tribals – so  why  should  they  be  reluctant  to  spend  even  very  modest  amounts  on  rehabilitating  the  displaced?  Conclusion  As we can see, the existence of a right or a law or even a policy  on  paper  does  not  mean  that  it  exists  in  reality.  People  have  had to constantly work on or make efforts to translate these  into  principles  that  guide  the  actions  of  their  fellow  citizens  or  even  their  leaders.  The  desire  for  equality,  dignity  and  respect is not new. It has existed in different forms throughout  our history as you have seen in this chapter.

      "Water as Part of the Fundamental Right  to Life  Water is essential for life and for good health. Not only is it  necessary for us to be able to meet our daily needs but safe  drinking water can prevent many water-related diseases. India  has one of the largest number of cases of diseases such as  diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera. Over 1,600 Indians, most of  them children below the age of  five, reportedly die everyday  because  of   water-related  diseases.  These  deaths  can  be  prevented if   people have access to safe drinking water.  The Constitution of India recognises the right to water as being  a part of the Right to Life under Article 21. This means that it  is the right of every person, whether rich or poor, to have  sufficient amounts of water to fulfil his/her  daily needs at a  price that he/she can afford. In other words, there should be  universal access to water.  There have been several court cases in which both the High  “...  right  to  water  entitles  Courts and the Supreme Court have held that the right to safe  everyone  to  sufficient,  drinking water is a Fundamental Right.

The  judges directed the Mahbubnagar district collector to supply  25 litres of water to each person in the village.  Public Facilities  Like water, there are other essential facilities that need  to be provided for everyone. Last year you read about  two other such facilities: healthcare and sanitation.  Similarly,  there  are  things  like  electricity,  public  transport, schools and colleges that are also necessary.  These are known as public facilities.

      "The important characteristic of a public facility is that once it  is provided, its benefits can be shared by many people. For  instance, a school in the village will enable many children to get  educated. Similarly, the supply of  electricity to an area can be  useful for many people: farmers can run pumpsets to irrigate  their  fields,  people  can  open  small  workshops  that  run  on  electricity, students will find it easier to study and most people  in the village will benefit in some way or the other.  The Government’s Role  Given that public facilities are so important, someone must  carry   the  responsibility  of  providing   these   to  the people. This ‘someone’ is the government. One of the  most   important   functions  of   the  government  is  to  ensure  that  these  public  facilities  are  made  available  to  everyone.

For  example, what profit can accrue to a company for keeping  the  drains  clean  or  running  an  anti-malaria  campaign?  A  private  company  will  probably  not  be  interested  in  undertaking  such  work.  But, for other public facilities such as schools and hospitals,  private  companies  may  well  be  interested.  We  have  many  of  these,  particularly  in  large  cities.  Similarly,  if  you  are  living  in  a  city,  you  will  have  seen  private  companies  supplying  water  through  tankers  or  supplying  drinking  water  in  sealed  bottles.  In  such  cases,  private  companies  provide public facilities but at a price that only some people  can  afford.  Hence,  this  facility  is  not  available  to  all  at  an  affordable rate.

      "Water Supply to Chennai: Is it Available  to All?  While there is no doubt that public facilities should be made  available to all, in reality we see that there is a great shortage  of  such  facilities.  In  the  rest  of  this  chapter,  we  will  read  about  the  provision  of  water,  which  as  we  have  seen,  is  a  public  facility  of  great  importance.  Water supply in Chennai, as we saw at the beginning of the  chapter, is marked by shortages. Municipal supply meets only  about half the needs of the people of the city, on an average.  There are areas which get water more regularly than others.  Those areas that are close to the storage points get more water  whereas  colonies  further  away  receive  less  water.  The  burden  of  shortfalls  in  water  supply  falls  mostly  on  the  poor.  The  middle  class,  when  faced  with  water  shortages,  are  able  to  cope  through  a  variety  of  private  means such as digging borewells, buying water from tankers  In rural areas, water is needed both for human  use and for use by the cattle.

Once again, the wealthy have more  choices,  thanks  to  the  booming  market  in  bottled  water  and  water  purifiers.  People  who  can  afford  it  have  safe  drinking  water,  whereas  the  poor  are  again  left  out.  In  reality, therefore, it seems that it is only people with money  who  have  the  right  to  water  –  a  far  cry  from  the  goal  of  universal access to ‘sufficient and safe’ water.  Taking water from farmers  The  shortage  of  water  has  opened  up  opportunities  for  private  companies  in  a  big  way.  Many  private  companies  are  providing  water  to  cities  by  buying  it  from  places  around  the  city.  In  Chennai,  water  is  taken  from  nearby  towns  like  Mamandur,  Palur,  Karungizhi  and  from  villages  to  the  north  of  the  city  using  a  fleet  of  over  13,000  water  tankers.

This  is  water  taken  away  not  just  from  agriculture  but  also  from  the  drinking  water  supplies  of  the  villagers.

      "In Search of Alternatives  The situation in Chennai is not unique. A similar  scenario of shortages and acute crisis during the  summer months is common to other cities of  India.  The  shortage  in  municipal  water  is  increasingly  being  filled  by  an  expansion  of  private  companies  who  are  selling  water  for  profit.

      "But  merely  making  laws  is  not  enough.  The  government  has to ensure that these laws are implemented. This means  that the law must be enforced. Enforcement becomes even  more  important  when  the  law  seeks  to  protect  the  weak  from the strong. For instance, to ensure that every worker  gets  fair  wages,  the  government  has  to  regularly  inspect  work  sites  and  punish  those  who  violate  the  law.  When  workers  are  poor  or  powerless,  the  fear  of  losing  future  earnings or facing reprisals often forces them to accept low  wages.  Employers  know  this  well  and  use  their  power  to  pay workers less than the fair wage. In such cases, it is crucial  that  laws  are  enforced.  Through  making,  enforcing  and  upholding  these  laws,  the  government  can  control  the  activities  of  individuals  or  private  companies  so  as  to  ensure  social  justice.  Many  of  these  laws  have  their  basis  in  the  Fundamental  Rights  guaranteed  by  the  Indian  Constitution.  For  instance,  the  Right  against  Exploitation  says  that  no  one  can  be  forced  to  work  for  low  wages  or  under  bondage.  Similarly,  the  Constitution lays down “no child below the age of 14 years  shall be employed to work in any factory or mines or engaged  in any other hazardous employment.”  How are these laws played out in practice? To what extent  do they address the concerns of social justice? These are  some of the questions that this chapter will now go on to  explore.  According  to  the  2011  census,  over  4  million  children  in  India  aged  between  5  and  14  work  in  various  occupations  including  hazardous  ones. In 2016, Parliament amended the Child Labour (Prohibition and  Regulation) Act, 1986, banning the employment of children below the  age of 14 years in all occupations and of adolescents (14-18 years) in  hazardous occupations and processes. It made employing these children  or  adolescents  a  cognizable  offence.  Anyone  found  violating  the  ban  must  be  penalized  with  a  punishment  ranging  from  a  jail  term  of  six  months to two years and/or fine of ` 20,000 to ` 50,000. The central  government had asked state governments to develop plans to rescue  and rehabilitate children who are working.  An  online  portal,  https://pencil.gov.in,  Platform  for  Effective  Enforcement  for  No  Child  Labour  (PENCIL)  has  become  functional  in  2017. It is meant for filing of complaint, child tracking, implementation  and monitoring of National Child Labour Project (NCLP).  Chapter 8: Law and Social Justice  103 \n",

      "What is a Worker’s Worth?  If  we  are  to  understand  the  events  leading  to  Bhopal  disaster, we have to ask: why did Union Carbide set up its  plant  in  India?

Wages  that  the  companies  pay  to  workers,  say in the U.S.A., are far higher than what they have to pay  to  workers  in  poorer  countries  like  India.

      "Advanced  countries  are  relocating  the  toxic  and  hazardous industries to developing countries to  take advantage of the weaker laws in these  countries and keep their own countries safe.  South Asian countries – particularly India,  Bangladesh and Pakistan – play hosts for  industries producing pesticides, asbestos or  processing zinc and lead.  Ship-breaking is another hazardous industry that  is growing rapidly in South Asia. Old ships no  longer in use, are sent to ship-yards in  Bangladesh and India for scrapping. These ships  contain potentially dangerous and harmful  substances. This photo shows workers breaking  down a ship in Alang, Gujarat.  Conclusion  Laws are necessary in many situations, whether this be the  market, office or factory so as to protect people from unfair  practices. Private companies, contractors, business persons,  in  order  to  make  higher  profits,  resort  to  unfair  practices  such as paying workers low wages, employing children for  work, ignoring the conditions of work, ignoring the damage  to  the  environment  (and  hence  to  the  people  in  the  neighbourhood)  etc.  A  major  role  of  the  government,  therefore,  is  to  control  the  activities  of  private  companies  by  making,  enforcing  and  upholding  laws  so  as  to  prevent  unfair  practices  and  ensure  social  justice.  This  means  that  the  government  has  to make ‘appropriate laws’ and also has to enforce the laws.  Laws that are weak and poorly enforced can cause serious  harm, as the Bhopal gas tragedy showed.  While  the  government  has  a  leading  role  in  this  respect,  people  can  exert  pressure  so  that  both  private  companies  and  the  government  act  in  the  interests  of  society.  Environment, as we saw, is one example where people have  pushed a public cause and the courts have upheld the right  to healthy environment as intrinsic to the Right to Life. In  this chapter, we have argued that people now must demand  that this facility of healthy environment be extended to all.  Likewise,  workers’  rights  (right  to  work,  right  to  a  fair  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)  wage  and  decent  work  conditions)  is  an  area  where  the  www.in.undp.org  situation  is  still  very  unfair.  People  must  demand  stronger  laws protecting workers’ interests so that the Right to Life  is achieved for all.  110  Social  and  Political  Life \n",

      "All  such  historical  questions  refer  us  back  to   notions  of  time.  But  time  does  not  have  to  be  always   precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month.   Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates   to processes that happen over a period of time. People   in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they   developed  a  taste  for  it  over  time.  There  can  be  no   one  clear  date  for  a  process  such  as  this.  Similarly,   we  cannot  fix  one  single  date  on  which  British  rule   was established, or the national movement started, or   changes took place within the economy and society. All   these things happened over a stretch of time. We can   only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over   which particular changes became visible.  Why, then, do we continue to associate history with   a string of dates? This association has a reason. There   was a time when history was an account of battles and big   events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians   wrote  about  the  year  a  king  was  crowned,  the  year  he   married,  the  year  he  had  a  child,  the  year  he  fought  a   particular war, the year he died, and the year the next   ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these,   specific dates can be determined, and in histories such   as these, debates about dates continue to be important.   As you have seen in the history textbooks of the past   two  years,  historians  now  write  about  a  host  of  other   issues,  and  other  questions.  They  look  at  how  people   earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how   cities  developed  and  markets  came  up,  how  kingdoms   were  formed  and  new  ideas  spread,  and  how  cultures   and society changed.

All the dates in these history books   were  linked  to  these  personalities  –  to  their  activities,   policies and achievements. It was as if there was nothing   outside their lives that was important for us to know. The   chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of   the history of British India.   Can we not write about the history of this period in a   different way? How do we focus on the activities of different   groups and classes in Indian society within the format of   this history of Governor-Generals?

      "this, it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts,   institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the   British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure   the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For   India was not capable of progress without British help.  In this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces   of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was   one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?  In any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu”   or “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously   in  these  periods?  Why  should  we  characterise  an  age  only   through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to   suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really   matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient   India did not all share the same faith.  Moving  away  from  British  classification,  historians   have  usually divided Indian history into ‘ancient’, ‘medieval’   and  ‘modern’.  This  division  too  has  its  problems.  It  is  a   periodisation  that  is  borrowed  from  the  West  where  the   modern  period  was  associated  with  the  growth  of  all  the    forces  of  modernity  –  science,  reason,  democracy,  liberty   and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society   where these features of modern society did not exist. Can   we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern   period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in   this book, under British rule people did not have equality,   freedom  or  liberty.  Nor  was  the  period  one  of  economic   growth and progress.  Many historians therefore refer to this period as ‘colonial’.   What is colonial?   In this book, you will read about the way the British came   to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating   local  nawabs  and  rajas.  You  will  see  how  they  established   control  over  the  economy  and  society,  collected  revenue  to   meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low   prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will   understand the changes that came about as a consequence.   You will also come to know about the changes British rule   brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices.   When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these   kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we   refer to the process as colonisation.   You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not   experience these changes in the same way. That is why, the   book is called Our Pasts in the plural.  4   OUR PASTS – III  chap 1-4.indd   4  4/22/2022   2:49:18 PM \n",

This  meant  that   no  other  trading  group  in   England could compete with   the East India Company. With   this  charter,  the  Company   could  venture  across  the   oceans, looking for new lands   from which it could buy goods   Fig. 2 –  Routes to India in the   at  a  cheap  price,  and  carry  them  back  to  Europe  to   eighteenth century  sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear   competition  from  other  English  trading  companies.   Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit   primarily  by  excluding  competition,  so  that  they  could   buy cheap and sell dear.

By  the  early  seventeenth   century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities   of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders   arrived on the scene.   The  problem  was  that  all  the  companies  were   interested  in  buying  the  same  things. The  fine  qualities   of  cotton  and  silk  produced  in  India  had  a  big  market   in  Europe.  Pepper,  cloves,  cardamom  and  cinnamon   too  were  in  great  demand.  Competition  amongst  the   European  companies  inevitably  pushed  up  the  prices   at  which  these  goods  could  be  purchased,  and  this   reduced  the  profits  that  could  be  earned.  The  only  way   the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating   rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore,   led  to  fierce  battles  between  the  trading  companies.   Through  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries  they   regularly  sank  each  other’s  ships,  blockaded  routes,   and  prevented  rival  ships  from  moving  with  supplies  of   10   OUR PASTS – III  chap 1-4.indd   10  4/22/2022   2:49:26 PM \n",

      "How trade led to battles  Through the early eighteenth century, the conflict between   the  Company  and  the  nawabs  of  Bengal  intensified.    After  the  death  of  Aurangzeb,  the  Bengal  nawabs   asserted  their  power  and  autonomy,  as  other  regional   powers  were  doing  at  that  time.  Murshid  Quli  Khan   was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah   as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong   ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions,   demanded  large  tributes  for  the  Company’s  right  to   trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it   from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company   of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving   the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and   undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing   Fig. 4 – Robert Clive   to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to   humiliate the nawab and his officials.   The  Company  on  its  part  declared  that  the  unjust   demands  of  the  local  officials  were  ruining  the  trade  of   the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties   were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade,   it  had  to  enlarge  its  settlements,  buy  up  villages,  and   rebuild its forts.      The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated   in the famous Battle of Plassey.  Puppet – Literally, a toy   The Battle of Plassey   that you can move with   strings.

The  Marathas  were  subdued  in  a  series  of  wars.   Confederacy – Alliance  In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of   Salbai,  there  was  no  clear  victor.  The  Second  Anglo-  Maratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts,   resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories   north  of  the  Yamuna  river  including  Agra  and  Delhi.   Finally, the Maratha power came to end with the Third    Anglo-Maratha  War  of  1817–19.  The  Peshwa  was   removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a   pension. The Company now had complete control over   the territories south of the Vindhyas.   The claim to paramountcy  I t   i s   c l e a r   f r o m   t h e   a b o v e   t h a t   f r o m   t h e   e a r l y   nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive   policy  of  territorial  expansion.  Under  Lord  Hastings   (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of   “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed   Fig. 11 – Lord Hastings  that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its   power was greater than that of Indian states. In order   to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or   threatening  to  annex  any  Indian  kingdom.  This  view   continued to guide later British policies as well.   This process, however, did not go unchallenged.

      "In  the  late  1830s,  the  East  India   Company became worried about Russia.   It  imagined  that  Russia  might  expand   across  Asia  and  enter  India  from  the   north-west.

Peasants who were initially tempted   by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The   price they got for the indigo they produced was very low   and the cycle of loans never ended.

      "the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter   of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government   sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate   Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not   be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around   that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be   sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control   an explosive situation, but his action was read as support   for the rebellion.   As  the  rebellion  spread,  intellectuals  from  Calcutta   rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of   the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of   the indigo system.   Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in   the military to protect the planters from assault, and set   up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of   indigo  production.  The  Commission  held  the  planters   guilty,  and  criticised  them  for  the  coercive  methods   they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo   production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission   asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told   them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future.

      "How did Tribal Groups Live?  By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts   of India were involved in a variety of activities.   Some were jhum cultivators  Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting   cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly   in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight   to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land   to clear it for cultivation. They spread  the ash from the   firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They   used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil   in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the   seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of   ploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop   Fallow – A field left   was  ready  and  harvested,  they  moved  to  another  field.   uncultivated for a while   A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for   so that the soil recovers   several years,   fertility  Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested   Sal – A tree  tracts of north-east and central India.

      "From  where  did  these  forest   people  get  their  supplies  of  rice   and  other  grains?  At  times  they   exchanged  goods  –  getting  what   they  needed  in  return  for  their   valuable forest produce. At other   times, they bought goods with the   small  amount  of  earnings  they   had.  Some  of  them  did  odd  jobs   in  the  villages,  carrying  loads   or  building  roads,  while  others   laboured in the fields of peasants   and  farmers.  When  supplies  of   forest  produce  shrank,  tribal   people had to increasingly wander   around  in  search  of  work  as   labourers.

      "Source 1  A time to hunt, a time to sow, a time to move to a new field  Have  you  ever  noticed  that  people  living  in  different  types  of  societies  do  not   share the same notion of work and time? The lives of the shifting cultivators and   hunters in different regions were regulated by a calendar and division of tasks   for men and women.   Verrier Elwin, a British anthropologist who lived among the Baigas and Khonds   of central India for many years in the 1930s and 1940s, gives us a picture of what   this calendar and division of tasks was like. He writes:    In Chait women went to clearings to ... cut stalks that were already reaped;   men  cut  large  trees  and  go  for  their  ritual  hunt.  The  hunt  began  at  full   moon from the east. Traps of bamboo were used for hunting. The women   gathered fruits like sago, tamarind and mushroom. Baiga women can only   gather roots or kanda and mahua seeds. Of all the adivasis in  Central India, the   Baigas were known as the best hunters … In Baisakh the firing of the forest   took  place,  the  women  gathered  unburnt  wood  to  burn.  Men  continued   to  hunt,  but  nearer  their  villages.  In  Jeth  sowing  took  place  and  hunting   still went on. From Asadh to Bhadon the men worked in the fields. In Kuar   the  first  fruits  of  beans  were  ripened  and  in  Kartik  kutki  became  ripe.  In   Aghan every crop was ready and in Pus winnowing took place. Pus was also   the time for dances and marriages. In   Magh  shifts  were  made  to  new  bewars   and  hunting-gathering  was  the  main   subsistence activity.   The  cycle  described  above  took   place  in  the  first  year.  In  the  second   year there was more time for hunting   as  only  a  few  crops  had  to  be  sown   and  harvested.  But  since  there  was   enough  food  the  men  lived  in  the   bewars.  It  was  only  in  the  third  year   that the diet had to be supplemented   with the forest products.  Adapted from Verrier Elwin, Baiga (1939) and Elwin’s   unpublished ‘Notes on the Khonds’ (Verrier Elwin   Papers, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library)   Activity  Look carefully at the tasks that Baiga   men and women did. Do you see any   pattern? What were the differences   Fig. 4 – A Santhal girl carrying firewood,   in the types of work that they were   Bihar, 1946  expected to perform?

They  began   to  use  the  plough,  and  gradually  got  rights  over  the   land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of   Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole.   All members of the clan were regarded as descendants   of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land.   Therefore,  all  of  them  had  rights  on  the  land.  Very   often some people within the clan acquired more power   than others, some became chiefs and others followers.   Powerful  men  often  rented  out  their  land  instead  of   cultivating it themselves.

They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster   of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their   administrative power and were forced to follow laws made   by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute   to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf   of  the  British.

Some peasants were declared landowners, others   tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were   to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue   to the state.  The British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not   very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in   areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact,   jhum  cultivators  who  took  to  plough  cultivation  often   suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields.   So  the  jhum  cultivators  in  north-east  India  insisted   on  continuing  with  their  traditional  practice.  Facing   widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow   them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some   parts of the forest.

      "Forest laws and their impact  The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly   connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a   considerable  effect  on  tribal  lives.  The  British  extended   their control over all forests and declared that forests were   state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved   Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted.   In  these  forests  people  were  not  allowed  to  move  freely,   practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals.   How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation?   Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search   of work and livelihood.

      "Many tribal groups reacted against the   colonial  forest  laws.  They  disobeyed  the   new  rules,  continued  with  practices  that   were  declared  illegal,  and  at  times  rose   in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of   Songram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and   the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the   Central Provinces.  The problem with trade  During  the  nineteenth  century,  tribal   groups  found  that  traders  and  money-  lenders were coming into the forests more   often,  wanting  to  buy  forest  produce,   offering  cash  loans,  and  asking  them  to   work for wages. It took tribal groups some   time  to  understand  the  consequences  of   what was happening.  Let  us  consider  the  case  of  the  silk   growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian   silk was in demand in European markets.   The fine quality of Indian silk was highly   valued  and  exports  from  India  increased   Fig. 8 – Godara women weaving  rapidly.  As  the  market  expanded,  East  India  Company   officials  tried  to  encourage  silk  production  to  meet  the   growing demand.   Hazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area   where  the  Santhals  reared  cocoons.  The   traders dealing in silk sent in their agents   who gave loans to the tribal people and   collected  the  cocoons.  The  growers   were paid `  3 to ` 4 for a thousand   cocoons. These were then   exported to Burdwan or   Gaya  where  they  were   sold  at  five  times  the   price.

      "Peshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father’s   pension  when  the  latter  died.  However,  the  Company,   confident  of  its  superiority  and  military  powers,  turned   down these pleas.   Awadh was one of the last territories to be annexed.   In 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh,   and  in  1856  it  was  taken  over.  Governor -General   Dalhousie  declared  that  the  territory  was  being   misgoverned  and  British  rule  was  needed  to  ensure   proper administration.   The  Company  even  began  to  plan  how  to  bring  the   Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king   was removed from the coins minted by the Company. In   1849, Governor-General Dalhousie announced that after   the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king   would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another   place  in  Delhi  to  reside  in.  In  1856,  Governor-General   Canning  decided  that  Bahadur  Shah  Zafar  would  be   the  last  Mughal  king  and  after  his  death  none  of  his   descendants would be recognised as kings – they would   just be called princes.  The peasants and the sepoys  In  the  countryside,  peasants  and  zamindars  resented   the  high  taxes  and  the  rigid  methods  of  revenue   collection.  Many  failed  to  pay  back  their  loans  to  the   moneylenders  and  gradually  lost  the  lands  they  had   tilled for generations.   The  Indian  sepoys  in  the  employ  of  the  Company   also  had  reasons  for  discontent.  They  were  unhappy   about their pay, allowances and conditions of service.   Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious   sensibilities  and  beliefs.  Did  you  know  that  in  those   days  many  people  in  the  country  believed  that  if  they   crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste?   So when in 1824, the sepoys were told to go to Burma   by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused   to  follow  the  order,  though  they  agreed  to  go  by  the   land route. They were severely punished, and since the   issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a     Activity  new law which stated that every new person who took   Imagine you are a sepoy   up employment in the Company’s army had to agree to   in the Company army,   serve overseas if required.    advising your nephew   Sepoys  also  reacted  to  what  was  happening  in  the   not to take employment   countryside.

      "Responses to reforms   The  British  believed  that  Indian  society  had   to  be  reformed.  Laws  were  passed  to  stop  the   practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage   of  widows.  English-language  education  was   actively  promoted.  After  1830,  the  Company   allowed Christian missionaries to function freely   in its domain and even own land and property. In   1850, a new law was passed to  make conversion   to Christianity easier. This  law allowed an Indian   who had converted to Christianity to inherit the   property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to   feel that the British were destroying their religion,   their  social  customs  and  their  traditional  way    of life.   There were of course other Indians who wanted   to change existing social practices. You will read   about these reformers and reform movements in   Chapter 6.

Sitaram  Pande  was  recruited  in  1812  as  a  sepoy  in  the   Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in   1860.  He  helped  the  British  to  suppress  the  uprising  though  his  own   son  was  a  rebel  and  was  killed  by  the  British  in  front  of  his  eyes.  On   retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write   his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate   translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy   to Subedar.  Here is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote:  It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the   Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents   of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over   India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of   sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards   their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the   soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the   object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained   that this was wholly within the army’s powers if the soldiers would only   act together and do as they were advised.

Every village is held against   us, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.”  Many new leaders came up. For example,  Ahmadullah   Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule   of the British would come to an end soon. He caught   the imagination of the people and raised a huge force of   supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi,   a large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together   to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from   Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came   Fig. 9 – A portrait of Nana Saheb   to Delhi. He became a key military leader of the uprising.   In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel   sepoys and battled with the British for many months.   Leaders and fighters from across the land joined the fight.   The Company Fights Back  Unnerved by the scale of the upheaval, the Company   decided to repress the revolt with all its might. It brought   reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that   Fig. 10 –   A portrait of Vir Kunwar Singh  Fig. 11 – British forces attack   the rebels who had occupied   the Red Fort (on the right) and   Salimgarh Fort in Delhi (on the   left )  58   oUr pAStS – III  Chap 5.indd   58  14-03-2024   12:27:53 \n",

However, they   were  made  to  acknowledge  the  British  Queen  as  their  Sovereign   Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as   subordinates of the British Crown.  3.  It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army   would  be  reduced  and  the  number  of  European  soldiers  would  be   increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from   Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be   recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans.   4.  The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large   scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British   believed that they were responsible for the uprising in a big way.  5.  The British decided to respect the customary religious and   social practices of the people in India.  6.

      "The Khurda Uprising – A Case Study  Much before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at   a place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and   reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up   since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country.  Khurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of   Orissa, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and   1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had   to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath   Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under   compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of   fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into   negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath   Temple. But after the occupation of Orissa in 1803, the British showed no inclination to   oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Orissa   and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his   deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he   was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting   to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri.   This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Orissa, which paved   the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817.  Soon  after  taking  over  Khurda,  the  British  followed  a  policy  of  resuming  service   tenures.  It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks.  The severity of   the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of   revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection.  Consequently, there was large scale   desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of    short-term  settlements,  each  time  increasing  the  demands,  not  recognising  either  the   productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots.  No leniency was shown   even in case of natural calamities, which Orissa was frequently prone to.  Rather, lands of   defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal.    The  hereditary  Military  Commander  of  the  deposed  king,  Jagabandhu  Bidyadhar   Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among   the dispossessed land-holders.  He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years   survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for   their grievances as well as his own.   Over the years, what had added to these grievances   were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence   on  payment  of  revenue  in  the  new  currency,  (c)  an  unprecedented  rise  in  the  prices  of    food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly   because of which the traditional salt makers of Orissa were deprived of making salt, and    (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal   to Orissa. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse   for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape.  The uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and   other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took   away a large amount of government money.  Soon its ripples spread in different directions   with Khurda becoming its epicenter.  The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with   enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A ‘no-rent campaign’ was also started.   The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April   1817,  Buxi  Jagabandhu,  leading  five  to  ten  thousand  Paiks  and  men  of  the  Kandh  tribe   62   OUR PASTS – III  Chap 5.indd   62  7/5/2022   12:51:48 PM \n",

Seeing the situation going out of hand, the  British clamped Martial Law. The King   was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son.  The Buxi with his close   associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between   Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of   Orissa.  Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from   the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi   Jagabandhu and his associates.  In the ensuing operation, hundreds of Paiks were killed,   many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty.  Thus by   May 1817, the uprising was mostly contained.  However,  outside  Khurda  it  was  sustained  by  Buxi  Jagabandhu  with  the  help  of   supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender   in May 1825.  On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of ‘leniency, indulgence   and forbearance’ towards the people of Khurda.  The price of salt was reduced and necessary   reforms were made in the police and the justice systems.  Revenue officials found to be   corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands.    The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take   charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand.    In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Orissa, which had   far  reaching  effect  on  the  future  of  British  administration  in  that  part  of  the  country.

Jones discovered that his interests were shared by many   British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen   like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were   also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering   Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works   into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic   Society  of  Bengal,  and  started  a  journal  called  Asiatick   Researches.   Jones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular   attitude  towards  India.  They  shared  a  deep  respect  for   ancient  cultures,  both  of  India  and  the  West.  Indian   civilisation,  they  felt,  had  attained  its  glory  in  the   ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to   understand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred   Fig. 2 – Henry Thomas   and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period.

So Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient   texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and   making  their  findings  known  to  others.  This  project,  they   believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian   culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own   heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this   process, the British would become the guardians of Indian   culture as well as its masters.   Influenced  by  such  ideas,  many  Company  officials   argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather   than Western learning. They felt that institutions should   be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts   and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The   officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to   be taught what they were already familiar with, and what   they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to   them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to   win a place in the hearts of the “natives”; only then could   the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects.   With  this  object  in  view,  a  madrasa  was  set  up  in   Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian   Madrasa – An Arabic   and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established   word for a place of   in  Benaras  in  1791  to  encourage  the  study  of  ancient   learning; any type of   Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration   school or college  of the country.  66   OUR PASTS – III  Chap 6.indd   66  4/21/2022   12:18:02 PM \n",

      "Fig. 3 – Monument to Warren Hastings, by   Richard Westmacott, 1830, now in Victoria   Memorial in Calcutta  This image represents how Orientalists   thought of British power in India. You will   notice that the majestic figure of Hastings, an   enthusiastic supporter of the Orientalists, is   placed between the standing figure of a pandit   on one side and a seated munshi on the   other side. Hastings and other Orientalists   needed Indian scholars to teach them the   “vernacular” languages, tell them about local   customs and laws, and help  them translate   and interpret ancient texts.

      "The demand for moral education  The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by   the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century.   The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve   the  moral  character  of  the  people,  and  morality  could  be   improved only through Christian education.   Until  1813,  the  East  India  Company  was  opposed  to   missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities   would  provoke  reaction  amongst  the  local  population  and   make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to   establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the   missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under    the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press   was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818.  Over  the  nineteenth  century,  missionary  schools  were                set  up  all  over  India.

At times they were started   by a teacher (guru).   The  system  of  education  was  flexible.  Few  things   that you associate with schools today were present in   the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no   printed books, no separate school building, no benches   or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes,   no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no   regular  time-table.  In  some  places,  classes  were  held   under  a  banyan  tree,  in  other  places  in  the  corner  of   a  village  shop  or  temple,  or  at  the  guru’s  home.  Fee   depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay   more  than  the  poor.  Teaching  was  oral,  and  the  guru   decided  what  to  teach,  in  accordance  with  the  needs   of the students. Students were not separated out into   different classes: all of them sat together in one place.   The guru interacted separately with groups of children   with different levels of learning.   Adam discovered that this flexible system was suited   to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during   harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields.   The pathshala started once again when the crops had been   cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant   families could study.

      "that childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the   rigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up   by  the  British.  Teachers  had  to  be  imaginative,  understand   the child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According   to Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the   child to be creative, her sense of wonder.   Tagore  was  of  the  view  that  creative  learning  could  be   encouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to   set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural   setting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan), where living   in harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural   creativity.  In many senses, Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about   education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too.   Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship   of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements   of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within   Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and   technology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance.   Many individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the   way  a  national  educational  system  could  be  fashioned.  Some   wanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt   that the system could be extended so as to include wider sections   of people.

      "Women, Caste and   7  Reform  Have  you  ever  thought  of  how  children  lived  about  two   hundred  years  ago?  Nowadays  most  girls  from  middle-  class families go to school, and often study with boys. On   growing up, many of them go to colleges and universities,   and take up jobs after that. They have to be adults before   they are legally married, and according to law, they can   marry anyone they like, from any caste and community,   and  widows  can  remarry  too.  All  women,  like  all  men,   can  vote  and  stand  for   elections. Of course, these   rights  are  not  actually   enjoyed by all. Poor people   have little or no access to   education,  and  in  many   families,  women  cannot   choose their husbands.   Two  hundred  years  ago   things  were  very  different.   Most children were married   off  at  an  early  age.  Both   Hindu  and  Muslim  men   could  marry  more  than   one  wife.

      "Differences between men and women were not the   only ones in society. In most regions, people were divided   along lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered   themselves as “upper castes”. Others, such as traders   and moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were   placed after them. Then came peasants, and artisans   such as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras).   At  the  lowest  rung  were  those  who  laboured  to  keep   cities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper   castes considered “polluting”, that is, it could lead to   the loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated   many of these groups at the bottom as “untouchable”.   They  were  not  allowed  to  enter  temples,  draw  water   from  the  wells  used  by  the  upper  castes,  or  bathe  in   ponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as   inferior human beings.  Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many of   these norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us see   how this happened.   Working Towards Change  From the early nineteenth century, we find debates and   discussions  about  social  customs  and  practices  taking  on   a  new  character.  One  important  reason  for  this  was  the   development  of  new  forms  of  communication.  For  the   first  time,  books,  newspapers,  magazines,  leaflets  and   pamphlets were printed.

      "Rammohun Roy was keen to spread the knowledge of   Western education in the country and bring about greater   freedom and equality for women. He wrote about the way   women were forced to bear the burden of domestic work,   confined to the home and the kitchen, and not allowed to   move out and become educated.  Changing the lives of widows   Rammohun Roy was particularly moved by the problems   widows faced in their lives. He began a campaign against   the practice of sati.  Rammohun  Roy  was  well  versed  in  Sanskrit,  Persian   and several other Indian and Europeon languages. He tried   to  show  through  his  writings  that  the  practice  of  widow   burning  had  no  sanction  in  ancient  texts.  By  the  early   nineteenth century, as you have read in Chapter 6, many   Fig. 2 – Raja Rammohun Roy,   British officials had also begun to criticise Indian traditions   painted by Rembrandt Peale, 1833  and  customs.  They  were  therefore,  more  than  willing  to   listen to Rammohun who was reputed to be a learned man.   In 1829, sati was banned.   The  strategy  adopted  by  Rammohun  was  used  by   later  reformers  as  well.  Whenever  they  wished  to   challenge  a  practice  that  seemed  harmful,  they  tried   to find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts   that supported their point of view. They then suggested   that the practice as it existed at present was against   early tradition.

Some of these were written as a dialogue between the   advocate and critic of a traditional practice. Here is one such   dialogue on sati:   ADVOCATE OF SATI:  Women  are  by  nature  of  inferior  understanding,   without resolution, unworthy of trust … Many of them,   on the death of their husbands, become desirous of   accompanying them; but to remove every chance of   their trying to escape from the blazing fire, in burning   Activity  them we first tie them down to the pile.

For  instance,  one  of  the  most  famous  reformers,   Ishwarchandra  Vidyasagar,  used  the  ancient  texts  to   suggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was   adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856   permitting  widow  remarriage.  Those  who  were  against   the remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even   boycotted him.   By  the  second  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the   movement in favour of widow remarriage spread to other   parts of the country. In the Telugu-speaking areas of   the Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed   an association for widow remarriage. Around the same   time,  young  intellectuals  and  reformers  in  Bombay   pledged themselves to working for the same cause. In   the north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the   reform association called Arya Samaj, also supported    widow remarriage.   Fig. 4 – Swami Dayanand   Yet,  the  number  of  widows  who  actually  remarried   Saraswati  remained low.

His suggestion was   adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856   permitting  widow  remarriage.  Those  who  were  against   the remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even   boycotted him.   By  the  second  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the   movement in favour of widow remarriage spread to other   parts of the country. In the Telugu-speaking areas of   the Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed   an association for widow remarriage. Around the same   time,  young  intellectuals  and  reformers  in  Bombay   pledged themselves to working for the same cause. In   the north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the   reform association called Arya Samaj, also supported    widow remarriage.   Fig. 4 – Swami Dayanand  \n",

      "Girls begin going to school  Many  of  the  reformers  felt  that  education  for  girls  was   necessary in order to improve the condition of women.   Vidyasagar in Calcutta and many other reformers in   Bombay set up schools for girls. When the first schools   were  opened  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  many   people  were  afraid  of  them.  They  feared  that  schools   would take girls away from home, prevent them from   doing their domestic duties. Moreover, girls had to travel   through public places in order to reach school. Many   people felt that this would have a corrupting influence   on  them.  They  felt  that  girls  should  stay  away  from   public  spaces.  Therefore,  throughout  the  nineteenth   century, most educated women were taught at home by   liberal fathers or husbands. Sometimes women taught   themselves.  Do  you  remember  what  you  read  about   Fig. 5  Rashsundari Debi in your book Social and Political Life   Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar  last year? She was one of those who secretly learned   to  read  and  write  in  the  flickering  light  of  candles    at night.

      "Law against child marriage    With the growth of women’s organisations   a n d   w r i t i n g s   o n   t h e s e   i s s u e s ,   t h e   momentum  for  reform  gained  strength.   People  challenged  another  established   custom  –    that  of  child  marriage.  There   were a number of Indian legislators in the   Central Legislative Assembly who fought   to make a law preventing child marriage.   In 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act   was  passed  without  the  kind  of  bitter   debates  and  struggles  that  earlier  laws   had  seen.  According  to  the  Act,  no  man   below  the  age  of  18  and  woman  below   the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently   these limits were raised to 21 for men and   18 for women.  Fig. 8 – Bride at the age of eight  This is a picture of a child bride at the beginning of the   twentieth century. Did you know that even today over   20 per cent of girls in India are married below   the age of 18?  Caste and Social Reform  Some of the social reformers we have been discussing   also  criticised  caste  inequalities.  Rammohun  Roy   translated  an  old  Buddhist  text  that  was  critical  of   caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of   Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes.   In  Bombay,  the  Paramhans  Mandali  was  founded  in   1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these   reformers  and  members  of  reform  associations  were   people of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these   reformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch,   in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in   their lives.   There were also others who questioned the injustices   of  the  caste  social  order.  During  the  course  of  the   nineteenth  century,  Christian  missionaries  began   setting up schools for tribal groups and “lower”-caste   children. These children were thus equipped with some   resources to make their way into a changing world.  At the same time, the poor began leaving their villages   to look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There   was work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs   in municipalities.

      "Gulamgiri   One of the most vocal amongst the “low-caste” leaders was   Jyotirao Phule. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up   by Christian missionaries. On growing up, he developed   his  own  ideas  about  the  injustices  of  caste  society.  He   set  out  to  attack  the  Brahmans’  claim  that  they  were   superior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued   that the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside   the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true   children of the country – those who had lived here from   before the coming of the Aryans.  As the Aryans established   their  dominance,  they  began  looking  at  the  defeated   population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to   Phule, the “upper” castes had no right to their land and   power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people,   the so-called low castes.   Phule  claimed  that  before  Aryan  rule,  there  existed   Fig. 13 –  Jyotirao Phule  a  golden  age  when  warrior-peasants  tilled  the  land  and   ruled  the  Maratha  countryside  in  just  and  fair  ways.   He  proposed  that  Shudras  (labouring  castes)  and  Ati   Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste   discrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association   Phule founded, propagated caste equality.  Source 3   “Me here and you over there”   Phule was also critical of the anti-colonial nationalism that was   preached by upper-caste leaders. He wrote:  The Brahmans have hidden away the sword of their religion   which has cut the throat of the peoples’ prosperity and now   go about posing as great patriots of their country. They …     give this advice to ... our Shudra, Muslim and Parsi youth   Activity  that unless we put away all quarrelling amongst ourselves   Carefully read   about the divisions between high and low in our country   Source 3.

In  1873,  Phule  wrote  a  book  named  Gulamgiri,   meaning  slavery.  Some  ten  years  before  this,  the   American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end   of  slavery  in  America.

      "The Emergence of Nationalism  The  above-mentioned  developments  led  the  people  to   ask  a  crucial  question:  what  is  this  country  of  India   and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually   emerged  was:  India  was  the  people  of  India  –  all  the   people  irrespective  of  class,  colour,  caste,  creed,   language, or gender. And the country, its resources and   systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer   came  the  awareness  that  the  British  were  exercising   control over the resources of India and the lives of its   people,  and  until  this  control  was  ended,  India  could   not be for Indians.  This consciousness began to be clearly stated by the   political associations formed after 1850, especially those   that  came  into  being  in  the  1870s  and  1880s.  Most  of   these  were  led  by  English-educated  professionals  such   as  lawyers.  The  more  important  ones  were  the  Poona   Sarvajanik  Sabha,  the  Indian  Association,  the  Madras   Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and   of course the Indian National Congress.  Note  the  name,  “Poona  Sarvajanik  Sabha”.  The   literal meaning of “sarvajanik” is “of or for all the people”    (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these   associations functioned in specific parts of the country,   their  goals  were  stated  as  the  goals  of  all  the  people  of   India, not those of any one region, community or class.   Sovereign – The capacity   They  worked  with  the  idea  that  the  people  should  be   to act independently   sovereign – a modern consciousness and a key feature of   without outside   nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian   interference   people should be empowered to take decisions regarding   their affairs.    The dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the   1870s  and  1880s.  The  Arms  Act  was  passed  in  1878,   disallowing  Indians  from  possessing  arms.  In  the  same   year,  the  Vernacular  Press  Act  was  also  enacted  in  an   effort to silence those who were critical of the government.   The  Act  allowed  the  government  to  confiscate  the   assets  of  newspapers  including  their  printing  presses   if  the  newspapers  published  anything  that  was  found   “objectionable”.  In  1883,  there  was  a  furore  over  the   attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The   bill provided for the trial of British or European persons   by  Indians,  and  sought  equality  between  British  and   Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition   forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were   enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the   British in India.  94   OUR PASTS – III  Chap 8.indd   94  4/21/2022   12:30:30 PM \n",

      "The March to Dandi   Purna  Swaraj  would  never  come  on  its   own.  It  had  to  be  fought  for.  In  1930,   Gandhiji  declared  that  he  would  lead  a   march to break the salt law. According to   this law, the state had a monopoly on the   manufacture  and  sale  of  salt.  Mahatma   Gandhi  along  with  other  nationalists   reasoned  that  it  was  sinful  to  tax  salt   since it is such an essential item of our   food. The Salt March related the general   desire of freedom to a specific grievance   shared  by  everybody,  and  thus  did  not   divide the rich and the poor.    Gandhiji  and  his  followers  marched     for  over  240  miles  from  Sabarmati  to   the  coastal  town  of  Dandi  where  they   broke  the  government  law  by  gathering   natural  salt  found  on  the  seashore,    and  boiling  sea  water  to  produce  salt.   Fig. 12 – Mahatma Gandhi breaking the                     salt law by picking up a lump of natural salt,       Dandi, 6 April 1930  Women in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka  Women  from  diverse  backgrounds  participated  in  the  national  movement.   Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from   both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the   freedom struggle, for the women’s movement, and for themselves personally.    Both British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women’s participation gave   the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement   brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions,   in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men.  What such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai   of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed   foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence   and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning,   and organised prabhat pheris.  Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days   of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment.   Women, however, had to fight  for their right to participate in the movement.   During  the  Salt  Satyagraha,  for  instance,  even  Mahatma  Gandhi  was  initially   opposed to women’s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow   women to join the movement.

A Case Study  A massive landslide hit Pangi village near Reckong Peo in Kinnaur district of   Himachal Pradesh and damaged a 200-meter stretch of old Hindustan-Tibet   road, National Highway - 22. This landslide was triggered by intense blasting   at  Pangi  village.  Due  to  the  blasting  this  weak  zone  of  slope  collapsed  and   caused intense damage to the road and nearby villages.

Mitigation Mechanism  Advancement in scientific techniques has empowered us to understand what   factors  cause  landslides  and  how  to  manage  them.  Some  broad  mitigation   techniques of landslide are as follows:  •  Hazard  mapping  to  locate  areas  prone  to   landslides.

Water pollution can   be controlled by treating these effluents suitably before   releasing them in water bodies.

Nomadic  herding  is  practised  in  the  semi-arid   and  arid  regions  of  Sahara,  Central  Asia  and  some   parts of India, like Rajasthan and Jammu and   Kashmir.  In  this  type  of  farming,  herdsmen   move from place to place with their animals for   fodder  and  water,  along  defined  routes.  This   type of movement arises in response to climatic   constraints and terrain. Sheep, camel, yak and   goats are most commonly reared. They provide   milk,  meat,  wool,  hides  and  other  products  to   the herders and their families.

Plantations are a type of commercial farming   where single crop of tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew,   rubber, banana or cotton are grown. Large amount   of labour and capital are required. The produce may   be processed on the farm itself or in nearby factories.   The  development  of  a  transport  network  is  thus   essential for such farming.  Major  plantations  are  found  in  the  tropical   regions  of  the  world.  Rubber  in  Malaysia,  coffee   in  Brazil,  tea  in  India  and  Sri  Lanka  are  some   examples.  Major Crops  Fig 3.6: A Banana Plantation  A  large  variety  of  crops  are  grown  to  meet  the   requirement of the growing population. Crops also   supply  raw  materials  for  agro  based  industries.   Major  food  crops  are  wheat,  rice,  maize  and   millets. Jute and cotton are fibre crops.

This is used as raw material for   the  manufacture  of  a  number  of  other  products,  such   as  heavy  machinery,  building  materials  and  railway   coaches. Marine based industries use products from the   sea and oceans as raw materials. Industries processing   sea food or manufacturing fish oil are some examples.   Forest  based  industries  utilise  forest  produce  as  raw   materials. The industries associated with forests are pulp   and paper, pharmaceuticals, furniture and buildings.  Size:    It  refers  to  the  amount  of  capital  invested,   number  of  people  employed  and  the  volume  of   production. Based on size, industries can be classified   into  small  scale  and  large  scale  industries.   Cottage  or  household  industries  are  a  type   of  small  scale  industry  where  the  products   are  manufactured  by  hand,  by  the  artisans.   Basket weaving, pottery and other handicrafts   are  examples  of  cottage   industry.  Small   scale  industries  use  lesser  amount  of  capital   and  technology  as  compared  to  large  scale   industries  that  produce  large  volumes  of   products.

The world population   has not been stable. It has increased manifold as seen   in the Fig 5.3. Why?  This is actually due to changes in   the number of births and deaths.  For an extremely long   period  of  human  history,  until  the  1800s,  the  world’s   population grew steadily but slowly. Large numbers of   babies were born, but they died early too. This was as   there were no proper health facilities. Sufficient food was   not available for all the people. Farmers were not able   to produce enough to meet the food requirements of all   the people. As a result the total increase in population   was very low.  In  1804,  the  world’s  population  reached  one   billion.  A  hundred  and  fifty  five  years  later,  in  1959,   the  world’s  population  reached  3  billion.  This  is  often   called  population  explosion.  In  1999,  40  years  later,   the  population  doubled  to  6  billion.  The  main  reason   for this growth was that with better food supplies and   medicine,  deaths  were  reducing,  while  the  number  of   births still remained fairly high.  Births are usually measured using the birth rate i.e.   the number of live births per 1,000 people. Deaths are   usually measured using the death rate i.e. the number   of deaths per 1,000 people. Migrations is the movement   of people in and out of an area.  Births  and  deaths  are  the   natural  causes  of  population   change. The difference between   the  birth  rate  and  the  death   rate  of  a  country  is  called  the   natural growth rate.  The  population  increase  in   the world is mainly due to rapid   increase in natural growth rate.    Fig 5.3: World Population Growth  47 \n",

Although, the world’s total population is rising   rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth.  Some countries like Kenya have high population growth   rates. They had both high birth rates and death rates.   Now,  with  improving  health  care,  death  rates  have   fallen, but birth rates still remain high leading to high   growth rates.

      "The shape of the population pyramid tells the story   of  the  people  living  in  that  particular  country.  The   numbers of children (below 15 years) are shown at the   bottom  and  reflect  the  level  of  births.  The  size  of  the   top shows the numbers of aged people (above 65 years)   and reflects the number of deaths.   The  population  pyramid  also  tells  us  how  many   dependents there are in a country. There are two groups   of dependents — young dependents (aged below 15 years)   and elderly dependents (aged over 65 years). Those of the   working age are the economically active.

This  situation  is   typified  by  the  pyramid   shown for Kenya (Fig 5.7).

This can be seen in the pyramid for   India (Fig 5.8). Such populations contain a relatively   large number of young people and which means a   strong and expanding labour force.  In  countries  like  Japan,  low  birth  rates  make   the pyramid narrow at the base (Fig 5.9). Decreased   death  rates  allow  numbers  of  people  to  reach   old age.
